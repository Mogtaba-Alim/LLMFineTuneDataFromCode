Cescon1, 2, 3*and Benjamin Haibe-Kains1, 4, 5, 6* Abstract APOBEC cytidine deaminases have been implicated as major contributors to the mutation burden in many cancers on the basis of their mutational signature., A new experimental study sheds light on the inciting factors linking APOBEC3B expression to oncogene- and drug-induced replication stress., Footprints in the genome from patterns to processes The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Project has been an undisputed success in advancing our knowledge of the many and varied subtypes of cancer., The identification of recurrent somatic alteration s patterns of gene expression and relationships between these have provided a crucial re- source to inform our understanding of cancer biology and the development of biomarker-driven therapeutic strategies., Moreover analysis of the types of mutations in these estab- lished cancers has revealed mutational signatures that re- flect the processes that contributed to their genesis [1]., As expected the mutational footprints of tobacco smoking and ultraviolet damage featur e prominently in the cancers where epidemiologic links ar e established and well under- stood., More interesting however,  are those that were un- anticipated, such as the pattern of base changes consistent with the mutagenic activity o f the endogenous APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases., In a recently published study Kanu and colleagues from the Swanton laboratory investigate the molecular basis of this phenomenon in breast cancer cell lines [2]., The APOBEC enzymes primarily function in innate antiviral immunity and deaminate cytosine to uracil in single-stranded DNA to generate C > T and C > G muta- tions in a preferential motif., Many solid tumors bear these genomic hallmarks and are believed to reflect the damage * Correspondence, dave.cescon@uhn.ca , bhaibeka@uhnresearch.ca 1Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network,  Toronto,  ON, Canada Full list of author information is available at the end of the article caused by one or more APOBECs., First identified in breast cancer datasets [3 4], the mutagenic potential of the APO- BEC family of enzymes had been recognized in preclinical systems, but the inferred mutational burden across a high proportion of tumor types represented a surprising dis- covery., Of the candidate APOBECs capable of such mutagenesis APOBEC3B was fingered as the most likely culprit in large part because of its overexpression observed in cancer., Following these discoveries efforts quickly turned to the study of the upstream mechanisms of APOBEC dysregulation and the downstream conse- quences of this activity, in order to characterize this novel biology and pursue potential opportunities for cancer pre- vention or treatment., The complexity of this undertaking is significant. The seven human APOBEC3 family members share signifi- cant homology which limits the availability of reagents with high specificity., In addition mice only have a single APOBEC3, meaning that mouse models have limited ex- perimental application., Furthermore the biology is com- plicated by the existence of a common human germline deletion polymorphism in APOBEC3B, which eliminates the entire coding region of this gene but is paradoxically associated with an increased risk of breast cancer [5] and an increased burden of APOBEC-pattern mutations [6, 7]., It has been suggested recently that APOBE- C3Arather than 3B might be responsible for the bulk of APOBEC mutations in highly APOBEC-mutated tu- mors [7], but,  in light of the low levels of APOBEC3A expression in epithelial cells, the mechanism for this re- mains unclear., Connecting replication stress and APOBEC3B through ATR Kanu and colleagues focused on the association between replication stress and APOBEC3B activity in breast cancer cell lines, starting fr om the observation that the HER2-enriched subtype of breast cancers exhibits the greatest burden of APOBEC mutations [8] and the premise that oncogene-induced replic

mutagenesis [2]., They observe a trend of increased APOBEC3B but not APOBEC3A or APOBEC3G, ex- pression in HER2-enriched cell lines and demonstrate a correlation between the pres ence of markers of replica- tion stress and both APOBEC3B expression and biochem- ical APOBEC3 deamination activity under basal conditions., Nucleoside supplementation to relieve replication stress resulted in a reduction in APOBEC3B expression and APOBEC3 activity, supporti ng this association., Treat- ment of the MCF10A non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cell line with nine DNA-damaging or anti-metabolite d r u g sf o l l o w e db ym e a s u r e m e n to ft h es s D N Ad a m a g e marker pS4/8 RPA identified a relationship between those that induced the highest levels of both APOBEC3B and RPA phosphorylation, although this was not entirely reproduced in the estrogen-receptor-positive MCF7 breast cancer cell line., In their study the authors also showed that the APO- BEC3B upregulation following induction of replication stress is dependent on signaling through the ATR CHK1 (checkpoint kinase 1) pathway, providing a mechanism for the observed phenomena., While not a primary focus of the paper the authors examined the association between APOBEC3B expression and drug sensitivities., Interest- ingly they noted a trend between APOBEC3B expression levels and in vitro sensitivity to the novel oral CHK1 inhibitor CCT244747 and speculated that markers of replication stress, includin gA P O B E C 3 B , c o u l db eu s e f u lt o predict response to this agent., While CCT244747 is not in- cluded in the recent GDSC1000 pharmacogenomic dataset we did not observe a relationship between APOBEC3B ex- pression and either AZD7762 or Calbiochem 681640, which inhibit CHK1 (Additional file 1,  Supplementary methods,  Additional file 2,  Table S1), although the target selectivities of these three drugs do vary., By contrast the authors observed no correla tion between APOBEC3B ex- pression and sensitivity to the DNA-damaging and anti- metabolite drugs in their small panel of breast cancer cell linesresults we confirmed in GDSC1000 (Additional file 2, Table S1a,  b)., However when considering all cancer types and cell lines, APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B ex- pression was significantly associated with sensitivity to 16 and 38 drugs, respectively (false discovery rate <5 %,  correlation adjusted for tissue type,  Additional file 2, Table S1c,  d), raising the possibility that expression of these genes could mediate or mark sensitivity to anti- cancer agents., Together this report presents an important contribu- tion to the understanding of APOBEC3 dysregulation in cancer and is consistent with our previous observation that APOBEC3B is highly correlated with proliferation- related gene expression in large breast cancer datasets and across nearly all solid tumor types in TCGA [9]., Theconnection made here between replication stress and APOBEC upregulation highlights a particularly vulnerable context, where high levels of APOBEC3B enzyme and ssDNA substrate co-exist., It will be of great interest to see how generalizable the drug-induced upregulation of APOBEC3B is across cancer cell lines and to assess the impact of a broader group of drugs on APOBEC expression., Minding the As and Bs There remain many unanswered questions that must be addressed in order to decipher the APOBEC puzzle and translate these discoveries towards the clinic., Im- portantly evidence that upregulation of APOBEC3B contributes to therapeutic resistance or that its modu- lation improves disease control or anti-tumour activity of other agents is lacking., The widely reported associ- ations between increased APOBEC3B expression and outcomes in patients are likely confounded by the fact that its expression reflects a proliferative state., Indeed while expression levels point towards APOBEC3B as the guilty party, the increase in cancer risk among germ- line APOBEC3B deletion carriers [5] and the increased burden of APOBEC-pattern mutations [6] attributed to APOBEC3A [7] seen in these patients highlights key unre- solved issues., As Kanu and colleagues show APOBEC3A is barely detectable in breast cancer cell lines and was not increased by the stimuli that induced APOBEC3B., Whether or how APOBEC3A with its potent enzymatic activity, could be upregulated transiently under some condition to strike in a hit-and-run fashion is unknown., How- ever our analysis of breast cancer gene expression data shows clearly that the correlates of APOBEC3B expres- sion in tumors (proliferation) are distinct from all of the other members of the APOBEC3 family, which are very strongly associated with a STAT1/interferon sig- nature [9]., This observation together with the experi- mental data reported here, suggests that the inciting triggers for APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B expression are likely to differ., In conclusion Kanu and co lleagues provide import- ant insights into our understanding of the APOBEC phenomenon., Their careful experimentation comple- ments the growing body of genomics-based analyses that seek to fully decrypt how and why these immune defenders turn against our g enomes., Well-conducted experimental studies and continued interrogation of the genomes of nascent and late-stage cancers, both before and following treatment, will undoubtedly reveal much about this enemy within and should clarify the po- tential of translating this knowledge for the prevention or treatment of cancers where APOBEC operates.Cescon and Haibe-Kains

      "answer": "The paper addresses potential biases in the research by acknowledging the complexity of the biological systems involved and the limitations of the experimental models used. Specifically, it highlights the following points:\n\n1. **Homology Among APOBEC Family Members**: The authors note that the seven human APOBEC3 family members share significant homology, which complicates the availability of reagents with high specificity. This could lead to potential biases in interpreting results related to specific APOBEC enzymes.\n\n2. **Limitations of Mouse Models**: The paper mentions that mice only have a single APOBEC3, which limits the experimental application of mouse models for studying human APOBEC3 dysregulation. This limitation could introduce biases in translating findings from mouse models to human contexts.\n\n3. **Germline Deletion Polymorphism**: The existence of a common human germline deletion polymorphism in APOBEC3B is discussed, which eliminates the entire coding region of this gene but is paradoxically associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. This complexity suggests that the relationship between APOBEC3B expression and cancer risk may be confounded by genetic factors.\n\n4. **Confounding Factors in Clinical Associations**: The authors caution that widely reported associations between increased APOBEC3B expression and patient outcomes are likely confounded by the fact that its expression reflects a proliferative state. This indicates that observed correlations may not be directly causal and could be influenced by other underlying biological processes.\n\n5. **Experimental Validation**: The paper emphasizes the need for well-conducted experimental studies and continued interrogation of cancer genomes to clarify the potential of translating findings into clinical applications.

      "question": "Are there any contradictions between this paper's findings and previous research?",
      "answer": "Based on the content of the research paper, there are several points of potential contradiction or divergence between the findings of this paper and previous research:\n\n1. **Role of APOBEC3A vs. APOBEC3B**: The paper discusses a recent suggestion that APOBEC3A, rather than APOBEC3B, might be responsible for the majority of APOBEC mutations in highly mutated tumors. However, the authors note that APOBEC3A is barely detectable in breast cancer cell lines and does not increase in response to stimuli that induce APOBEC3B. This contrasts with previous studies that have attributed significant mutagenic activity to APOBEC3A, raising questions about the relative contributions of these two enzymes in breast cancer.\n\n2. **Germline Deletion Polymorphism**: The paper mentions that a common germline deletion polymorphism in APOBEC3B is paradoxically associated with an increased risk of breast cancer and an increased burden of APOBEC-pattern mutations. This finding seems to contradict the notion that higher expression of APOBEC3B is solely responsible for increased mutation rates, suggesting a more complex relationship between APOBEC3B expression, genetic polymorphisms, and cancer risk.\n\n3. **Drug Sensitivity Correlations**: The authors observed no correlation between APOBEC3B expression and sensitivity to certain DNA-damaging drugs in their small panel of breast cancer cell lines, which contrasts with previous findings that indicated a relationship between APOBEC expression and drug sensitivity across various cancer types. This inconsistency raises questions about the generalizability of APOBEC3B as a predictive marker for drug response.\n\n4. **Proliferation vs. APOBEC3B Expression**: The paper highlights that the associations between increased APOBEC3B expression and patient outcomes are likely confounded by its reflection of a proliferative state. This suggests that previous studies attributing prognostic significance to APOBEC3B expression may need to be re-evaluated, as they might not account for the underlying proliferation-related gene expression.\n\nOverall, while the paper provides important insights into the mechanisms linking replication stress and APOBEC3B expression, it also raises questions about the established roles of APOBEC enzymes in cancer mutagenesis and treatment response, indicating potential contradictions with previous research findings."
