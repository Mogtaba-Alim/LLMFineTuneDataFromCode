We are now witnessing the advent of precision oncology35that takes into account patients  genomic makeup for treatment decisions3, 6, 7., Treatment approval based on tumor-site agnostic molecular aberration biomarkers has become reality. The year 2017 marked the first FDA approval of such a treatment8. Based on clinical trials in 15 types of cancer pembrolizumab was approved for treatment of solid tumors withmismatch repair de ficiency or high microsatellite instability9., Larotrectinib is another promising treatment targeting the tropomyosin receptor kinase gene fusion in a variety of cancers10., Unfortunately, there are no established biomarkers for majority of the anticancer drug compounds. Identi fication of reliable biomar- kers is a challenge not only for the most commonly used cytotoxic drugs, but also in the case of targeted therapies as the drug targets alone are generally poor therapeutic indicators11, 12., Discovery of biomarkers predictive of drug response and development of multivariate companion diagnostics require efficient computational tools and substantial number of samples., Traditional statistical models and more sophisticated machine learning approaches have been used to build predictors of drugresponse and resistance both in the clinical13and preclinical14 settings., As predictive models increase in complexity the number of observations required to train these models increases as well.While omic pro files and clinical outcomes of patients are the most relevant data sources for the development of clinically relevant predictors, these datasets are often limited in size due to many factors including high costs, limited accrual rates,  and complex regulatory landscape., In addition by the nature of the experiment, unbiased testing of multiple therapeutic strategies for the same patient in the patient itself is practically infeasible., Cancer models provide access to patient tumors in preclinical models both in vivo and in vitro, allowing researchers to test multiple drugs and combinations in parallel 14., Although these preclinical models recapitulate patient therapy response to varying degrees they provide massive amounts of pharmacogenomic data for drug response prediction., Here we review the recent applications of machine learning to prediction of response to monotherapies and identi fication of combination therapies (Fig., 1). PREDICTION OF RESPONSE TO MONOTHERAPIES In vitro and ex vivo tumor modelsLarge-scale efforts to associate molecular pro files with drug response phenotypes in preclinical models date back to the late 90s when the National Cancer Institute Developmental Therapeu- tics Program released large-scale pharmacogenomic data of 60cancer cell lines (NCI60) screened with tens of thousands of chemical compounds, including a large panel of FDA-approved drugs 15., NCI60 facilitated several drug discoveries notably a 26S proteasome inhibitor bortezomib that is now used in multiple myeloma treatment15., Since then high-throughput in vitro drug screens of cancer cell lines (CCLs) derived by immortalization of human cancer cells became popular experimental bases for discovery of multi-omic underpinnings of drug sensitivity and 1Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network,  Toronto,  ON,  Canada.2Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto,  Toronto,  ON,  Canada.3Vector Institute,  Toronto,  ON, Canada.4Genetics and Genome Biology,  Hospital for Sick Children,  Toronto,  ON, Canada.5Department of Medical Biophysics,  University of Toronto,  Toronto,  ON, Canada.6Ontario Institute for Cancer Research,  Toronto,  ON,  Canada.email, benjamin.haibe-kains@uhnresearch.ca, anna.goldenberg@utoronto.cawww.nature.com/npjprecisiononcology Published in partnership with The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota1234567890(), , ,  resistance16., Since this seminal study multiple large-scale databases have been publicly released to the cancer researchcommunity17, 18., More recently advances in growing tumors in animal models enabled the generation of large collection of patient-derived xenografts (PDX) to monitor tumor growth withand without drug treatment in mice19., Novartis published the largest PDX-based pharmacogenomic dataset to date referred to as the PDX Encyclopedia20., The NCI recently announced the Patient-Derived Models Repository (PDMR) with comprehensivemolecular pro filing and commitment to release pharmacological profiles in the future., A series of databases and tools have been developed recently to harmonize and make easily availablemultiple pharmacogenomic studies investigating anticancermonotherapies (Table 1)., Methods for monotherapy prediction The availability of commercial drug response prediction approaches is limited., In fact publicly available methods mainly consist of biomarker assays which measure quantities such asgene expression and determine whether or not a speci fic therapy linked to the biomarker assay would be effective for a given patient., Most of these assays and predictive models are univariate with only a few multivariate assays that are based on simplestatistical and machine learning approaches (the OncotypeDx 21 and MAMMAPRINT22models for breast cancer are based on a linear regression model and a nearest centroid model, respectively)., Thus this review focuses on academic approaches to drug response prediction since they signi ficantly outnumber commercial approaches, are more transparent, and address themore dif ficult task of predicting the ef ficacy of multiple drugs without knowing ahead of time the useful features for the task., The most typical computational approaches to drug response prediction speci fically in preclinical models,  consist of (1) quanti fication of drug response, (2) molecular feature selection or dimensionality reduction of the cellular measurements, (3)machine learning model fitting to predict drug response,  and (4) model evaluation 23, 24., Multiple studies explored which genomic modalities harbor the most predictive signal of drug response byanalyzing performance of predictive models., The most commonlyutilized modalities include single nucleotide variations copynumber variations, RNA expression,  methylation,  and proteomics.Despite their widespread use in clinical settings, mutations andcopy number variations have been shown to account for only asmall subset of candidate biomarkers, while gene expression, methylation and protein abundance are regarded as the mostpredictive modalities 2527, each can be complemented by the multi-omic view of the cancer2830., Perhaps the main obstacle in effectively leveraging all data modalities is fusing them whileignoring redundancies., A combined set of measurements canreach hundreds of thousands of features while the number ofavailable patients or cell lines remains in the hundreds., Such ahigh feature to sample ratio is bound to lead to over fitting where Fig. 1 Graphical abstract. Patient data are limited so to predict drug response, much of the existing literature use model system data,  e.g., immortalized cell lines and PDX. aCurrently most patients in cancer are still treated in a one-size- fits-all manner according to the type (or subtype) of cancer they have., bThere is a growing number of examples of personalizing monotherapy in practice where depending on the mutations in the tumor,  the patient can be prescribed a targeted drug., This approach is applicable to fewer than 20% of the patients. Thecomputational contribution is to take a large number of model systems and patients when available and construct a predictive model to identify the best drug for majority of the patients., cDue to tumor heterogeneity and acquired drug resistance monotherapies may not be effective, there is currently a growing body of work predicting drug synergy and effective drug combinations., Originally these models weretrained using bulk data but more recently, single-cell data-based approaches are starting to show promise., The person symbol in the figure was obtained from dryicons.com.

Hormel Institute University of Minnesota1234567890(), , ,  a model can perfectly fit the limited size training set, yet will have poor generalization performance when tested on new data., Thislimits the class of applicable predictive models to those with low complexity such as support vector machines or logistic regression since high complexity models like deep neural networks requiremany samples to avoid over fitting., Successful applications of deep learning in domains such as image classi fication or machine translation have worked due to a more favorable measurement tosample ratio ( N> D) in addition to architectures that mimic the human brain and limit over fitting such as convolutional neural networks., Developing neural network architectures with an effective inductive bias for genomics will allow the complexunderlying cancer biology to be better modeled compared tolinear models which reduce risk of over fitting at the cost of introducing signi ficant modeling bias., Another approach to deal with the limited number of samples typically available in drugresponse prediction experiments is feature selection., Feature selection removes features such as the gene expression of genes which are determined to be uninformative for the phenotypebeing predicted., This improves the ratio of features to samples and a common to feature selection is univariate feature selection where only features highly corrected with the phenotype are kept., Multivariate approaches to feature also exist and consider sets offeatures at a time since any single feature individually might notbe predictive of the outcome, but that does not imply that a collection of features is uninformative as well., Papillon-Cavanagh et al. 31identi fied univariate feature selection as a robust selection approach later improved by minimum Redundancy,  MaximumRelevance (mRMR) Ensemble feature selection32., Costello et al. and Jang et al. performed extensive comparative analyses of machine learning methods for drug response prediction in cancercell lines, recommending using elastic net or ridge regression with input features from all genomic pro filing platforms27, 29., Costello et al. summarized a crowdsourced DREAM drug predictionchallenge29 revealing two leading trends among the most successful methods., First the importance of the ability to model nonlinear relationships between data and outcomes, and second,  the incorporation of prior knowledge,  e.g., biological pathways.The challenge winning model Bayesian multitask multiple kernellearning method 33, incorporated both of these approaches together with multi-drug learning34., Such multitask framing of the prediction problem is highly effective as it enables a moreefficient use of available data when tuning parameters., Speci fi- cally instead of building separate prediction models for each drug thereby using just a subset of the data, a single model trained withall the data that has some parameters shared amongst all thedrugs, and some drug-speci fic parameters is the better choice., Nonlinear relationships are of utmost importance since many cellular processes follow nonlinear dose-response relationshipssuch as the activation of MAPK via Progesterone in oocytes 35., Furthermore models encoding prior biological knowledge have improved and more stable feature selection since noisy gene-level measurements can be abstracted into gene sets that have beenexperimentally validated to be involved in cancer-related pro- cesses., Lee et al.36developed a method that integrates disease relevant multi-omic prior information to prioritize gene-drug associations., Most recently Zhang et al.37and Wang et al.38 introduced methods based on similarity network fusion and similarity-regularized matrix factorization, respectively,  that take into account similarity among cell lines,  drugs and targets., Drugchemical features and similarities were shown to be a promising additional information that can improve drug response prediction performance., There is no canonical way of incorporating drugfeatures into most predictive models since it is dif ficult to encode how the drug features and omics features interact., Future models that address this shortcoming are likely to outperform competitorsthat do not due to the highly informative content of molecular fingerprints., Speci fically a predictive model in a multitask setting can take compounds with known molecular targets, use the similarity computed between the molecular fingerprints, and more effectively tune parameters using similarity betweencompounds for parameter regularization., Deep learning methods for monotherapy prediction The use of neural networks for drug response prediction dates back to the 90s., El-Deredy et al. showed that a neural network trained on tumor nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra datahas potential as a drug response predictor in gliomas, and may be used to provide information about the metabolic pathways involved in drug response 39., Neural networks, however, did not become a method of choice for monotherapy prediction yet. In fact despite the recent prevalence of deep neural network (DNN) methods across many areas and industries, including relatedfields,  such as computational chemistry 4045, DNNs have only fairly recently found their way into the drug response prediction., The reason for this is the typically low ratio of the number of samplesto the number of measurements per sample that does not favor traditional feedforward neural architectures., Overparameterization in these models easily leads to over fitting and poor generalization to new datasets., However in recent years, more public data has become available and newly developed deep neural network models are showing promise., For example, Chang et al. 46 developed the CDRscan model featuring a convolutional neural network architecture trained on a dataset of ~1000 drug response experiments per compound., Their model achieved signi ficantly improved performance compared to other classical machine learning approaches such as Random Forests and SVM., Part of why CDRscan performed better than these baseline modelsresides in its ability to integrate genomic data and molecular fingerprints., In addition its convolutional architecture has shown to be effective in many machine learning domains., Takinginspiration from already well-established neural architectures and modifying their structure to properly handle genomic data is certainly a promising future direction.Table 1., Platforms harmonizing preclinical pharmacogenomic datasets and providing basic processing functions for biomarker discovery., Platforms Cancer models # Models # Drugs URL References PharmacoGx PharmacoDB Cell lines 1691 759 https, //bioconductor.org/packages/PharmacoGx/ http, //pharmacodb.ca/17, 111 GDSCTools Cell lines 1001 265 https, //gdsctools.readthedocs.io112 CellminerCDB Cell lines 1000 ~50, 000 https, //discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminercdb/113 CancerDP Cell lines 1061 24 http, //crdd.osdd.net/raghava/cancerdp/index.php114 PDXFinder PDX 567 33 https, //www.pdx finder.org/ Unpublished Xeva PDX 277 61 https, //github.com/bhklab/Xeva115 Cancer-Drug eXplorer 2D cell cultures 462 60 http, //cancerdrugexplorer.org/116G Adam et al., 3 Published in partnership with The Hormel Institute University of Minnesota npj Precision Oncology (2020) 19 Another promising direction is autoencoders that are able to learn from smaller datasets., An autoencoder is a neural network that compresses its input and tries to reconstruct the original datafrom the compressed representation., This is quite useful forfeature extraction as shown by Way and Greene 47where a 5000 dimensional gene expression pro file was compressed into just 100 dimensions, some of which represented phenotypically relevant features such as patient sex or melanoma status., Rampa sek et al.48 evaluated semi-supervised variational autoencoders on mono- therapy response prediction and developed an extension a joint drug response prediction model, Dr.VAE,  that leveraged pre- andpost-treatment gene expression in cell lines, showing improvedperformance in drug response prediction on a variety of FDA- approved drugs compared comprehensively to many classical machine learning approaches., This improvement could potentiallyhave been even greater if the model was setup in a multitaskfashion in combination with molecular fingerprints., Dincer et al. 49 developed DeepPro file a method that combined variational autoencoders to learn 8-dimensional representation of gene expression in AML patients and then used this representation to fit a Lasso linear model for drug response prediction with improved performance compared to no feature extraction.Similarly, Chiu et al.50pretrained autoencoders on mutation data and expression features on TCGA dataset and subsequentlytrained a deep drug response predictor., What differentiates their method from others is the use of pretraining. Pretraining allows for using unlabeled data from other sources such as TCGA insteadof just the gene expression pro files available from the drug response experiments, thereby signi ficantly increasing the number of samples available and improving performance compared tousing just the labeled data., The brief summary of methods is available in Table 2. The trend of model development shows that as more data become available and deep learning methods becomebetter adapted to high dimensional/low sample size data, there ishope for convergence and creation of sophisticated models thatwill likely push the field of computational drug response prediction forward to eventually become clinically relevant., RESISTANCE TO MONOTHERAPY While drug response prediction can help pick an optimal therapy given the current molecular characteristics of the cancer cells, tumors often exhibit drug resistance over the course of the treatment., Consequently patients that respond initially to therapyregress as their cancer either adapts to overcome the chosentreatment, or an existing resistant subclone repopulates the tumor 51., Understanding the common mechanisms cancers use to develop resistance can help inform treatment approaches tocounteract this phenomena., For therapies inhibiting the activity or signaling of their target a common mechanism towards resistance is feedback selecting forupregulated expression of the target protein., For example resistance to 5-FU has been demonstrated to arise from theampli fication of its target thymidylate synthase (TS) 52, with corresponding overproduction of TS enzyme and mRNA tran- scripts53., Furthermore especially for tyrosine kinase inhibitors, tumors will evolve to re-activate pathways downstream of thetargeted protein., A classical example is the resistance to the EGFRinhibitor Ge fitinib which can often be explained by an acquired T790M mutation reducing drug binding af finity 54., For DNA damaging compounds or compounds inhibiting DNA repair altered DNA damage response can lead to resistance., Studies have shown that treatment with cisplatin a DNAdamaging agent usually effective against BRCA de ficient cancers, can lead to mutations restoring BRCA function and subsequentlythe activity of the Homologous Repair (HR) pathway 55, 56., Furthermore studies suggest that secondary alterations to DNA damage response proteins can shift the response from the error- prone Non-Homologous End Joining pathway to HR, reducingsensitivity to DNA damaging agents57., Other mechanisms of resistance include modi fications to enzymes involved in drug metabolism to either reduce conversion of drugs to active forms or deactivate the compound58, 59,  and more recently,  intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH)60., As this review is focuses on drug response prediction not enough depth is provided to discussing howtumors acquire resistance to therapies, or how therapies work.Readers are referred to work by Holohan et al., 51, Housman et al.59, and Malhotra and Perry61for a comprehensive discussion on this topic.

It was revealed that for the cohort that used oxaliplatin as a chemotherapeutic agent survival was 5 months lower for patients that also received panitumumab, and there was a signi ficant increase in adverse effects such as infections and pulmonary embolism compared to patients that did not receive panitumumab., Tol et al. 66also performed a clinical trial for mCRC using combination of capecitabine,  oxaliplatin, andbevacizumab, as the baseline treatment to investigate cetuximab.Patients that received cetuximab had a shorter progression-freesurvival and reported signi ficantly more adverse effects compared to patients that did not receive cetuximab., One promising direction for a setting where the goal is to study a constrained set of options to design an optimal treatment planfor a patient is adaptive trials via reinforcement learning 67., The probabilistic ranking given by their method potentially allows for identifying when tumors develop drug resistance by analyzingwhen drug combinations are given priority over individualtreatments., While this work performed on PDX, learns more complex yet more effective policies in terms of survival than currently offered in the clinic, it is not clear how to mitigate thepotential risks of exploration needed for reinforcement learning.We do hope that this direction is given its due consideration in theclinic since these early results appear to be very promising., The limits of trial and error in the clinic can also be overcome in vitro with the use of preclinical models in the form ofimmortalized cancer cell lines or cell lines derived from patientbiopsies., Patient-derived cancer models allow screening drug combinations in parallel without subjecting patients to serious toxicity risk (Table 4)., Unfortunately due to the sheer number of possible drug combinations, it is not possible to explore theirpotential antagonism,  additive or synergistic effects 68, so there is a need for methods that can predict combination therapy response prior to experimentally validating it., Methods for combination therapy prediction Many computational methods have been developed to predict anticancer drug combination synergy based on a variety ofgenomic, drug structure,  and biological network data., Thesemethods vary in how much drug combination screening data isrequired, if used at all. Drug combination screening data refers to testing cancer models with combinations of two or more drugs rather than a single drug., A typical combination experiment setupinvolves testing two drugs at 8 different half-log dilution concentrations each including the null concentration as a control 69., This gives rise to an 88 dose-response matrix. Using a 384-well assay plate, six pairs of drugs can be screened at oncein this arrangement. Once cells are incubated in the wells for asufficient amount of time usually 72 h, a cell viability readout is conducted to determine the number of viable cells in each well., The collected data is then processed using a tool such as SynergyFinder 70to quantify the drug combination response compared to individual compound response based on a varietyof models., As an example the Bliss independence model71 provides a score under the assumption that the two drugs actindependently, so measurement above this score indicates synergy., For more details on different synergy scores as well as experimental design of drug combination studies, the reader isreferred to the experimental design guide by He et al., 69. The number of experiments increases exponentially with the numberof drugs tested in combination making these combination screens both logistically complex and expensive., It is therefore favorable to have a method which does not require signi ficant amounts of combination screens., Several approaches for drugsynergy prediction described in the literature instead use acombination of either perturbation experiments or sensitivityexperiments coupled with drug target and drug structure data., For example, the work done by Li et al. 72leverages gene expression perturbation data measured as the difference in gene expressionbefore and after treatment, to compute various statistics aboutdifferentially expressed genes as the main pharmacogenomicfeatures., Additionally the authors extracted drug physicochemical properties, distance between drug targets in PPI networks, and Jaccard similarity between targeted pathways to representbiological and chemical prior knowledge., These features werethen used to train a random forest model to perform the binaryprediction task of whether a drug combination is synergistic or not., Gayvert et al. 73also made predictions with random forests by using both single-drug response values and combination therapyresponse values when available., Interestingly they did notleverage drug structure information nor gene expression pro files when making predictions., This is a drawback since drug structureinformation is easily available and including it may improve performance, but it provides flexibility in not having to measure gene expression., However their framework is broadly applicable, and their results indicate that even a small number of drugcombination experiments can have a great performance bene fit when used to train a model that makes predictions using primarily single-drug response data., There is a class of drug combination optimization approaches that interacts with the user by suggesting promising combinationsto test., Both Weiss et al. 74and Nowak-Sliwinska et al.75use Feedback System Control (FSC) to iteratively re fine drug combinations and suggest new ones to test in vitro., The process works by first starting with some randomly selected drug combinations for some range of doses., This group ofTable 3.

This approach seems to be very effective in practice because the ef ficacy versus drug combination surface is smooth thereby allowing FSC toconverge in 10 15 iterations., Lastly the optimal drug combination identi fied by DE and evaluated in vitro is further optimized to eliminate redundant compounds or compounds having an antagonistic effects., Importantly FSC based approaches are not limited in the number of drugs used in a given combination, unlike many methods that are created speci fically for pairs of drugs., It might be possible to accelerate the convergence of FSC methods by including genomic or chemical data since both methods described above perform the optimization withoutconsidering drug targets or drug similarities., Deep learning methods for combination therapy prediction The most extreme prediction scenario is to not use drug response data at all when building a model., This is done by Preuer et al. 76 where the authors only leverage transcriptomic data and drugstructure data to predict Loewe score which quanti fies the excess over the expected response if the two drugs used in a combination were the same compound., What further differenti- ates this work from previous works is that the authors use deeplearning to achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline models such as gradient boosting machines, random forests,  and support vector machines., Xia et al. 77used deep learning as a means of simultaneously extracting and integrating features from multiple data types to predict the ef ficacy of drug pairs., Combination response data as well as gene expression microRNA, and protein abundance from the NCI-ALMANACdataset was used78., Additionally drug features were obtained using Dragon software79which provides chemical fingerprints and other properties., Each data type was passed through its own submodel where a submodel is just a deep fully connected neural network in order to obtain useful features and perform dimensionality reduction., Then these features for the different data types were concatenated and passed through a final submodel that uses residual connections in order to predict the drug combination score., Ultimately the authors were able toobtain impressive results with R^2 of 0.92, and much of that explained variance was due to the drug descriptors., These approaches reinforce the importance of newer deep learning methods such as molecular graph convolution to extract task- speci fic molecular fingerprints., A summary of tools related to drug combinations is provided in Table 5. In terms of the availability there are more synergy visualization tools rather than synergyprediction tools available to date., We hope that this trend will change as more researchers work on this important area and provide their tools in publicly available packages., DRUG COMBINATION DISCOVERY USING SINGLE-CELL SEQUENCING The development of single-cell sequencing technologies has given researchers a new set of tools to interrogate tumorheterogeneity., Single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNAseq) can be used to more directly investigate the clonal structure of a tumor., It works by isolating individual cells and performing whole genomeampli fication to increase the amount of DNA present in order to be detectable by a DNA sequencer 80., These data can be used to directly reconstruct the unique genotypes as well as to estimatethe clonal fraction within the sample., Bulk DNA sequencing doesnot have these abilities so simply identifying populations of cells with different mutations can already signi ficantly improve treatment plans (Table 3)., However scDNAseq data suffers from increased noise each cell has only two copies of each genomic locus, requiring ampli fication before sequencing 81., The ampli fica- tion process can introduce errors into the sequenced reads and ampli fication can be uneven across the genome as well as between cells, introducing bias into the observed reads., Computational approaches estimating tumor clonal composition while taking into account these sources of error have beendeveloped8284., For a thorough discussion of the methods used to analyze snDNAseq data we refer the reader to the work by Qi et al.85., Interestingly single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) is starting to be used to design novel drug combinations throughidentifying druggable subclones86, 87., Unlike DNA where each cell contains only one copy of each allele (to a total of 6 pg of DNA), there is approximately 30 pg of RNA in a single cell., With the advent of the Chromium platform it is also now possible tosequence the RNA across 100 000s of cells in a single experimentalrun 88., Predictive models of drug response could be developed and trained using high-throughput preclinical pharmacogenomic data, and an optimization framework to predict the most ef ficient and the least toxic combination treatment could be established., One of the first analyses to examine the in fluence of treatment on the transcriptome of cancer cells at single-cell resolution wasconducted by Suzuki et al.89., They first performed single-cell sequencing on four different cell lines derived from lung adenocarcinoma to compare the relative divergence in their gene expression pro files., Even though the average gene expression levels were generally similar the relative divergences between celltypes were pronounced., To investigate how targeted therapy affects individual cells they treated LC2/ad cell line and the derived resistant version of it with vandetanib, a multi-tyrosinekinase inhibitor., The comparison of single-cell pro files of treated cells versus parental cells identi fied a wide variety of genes overexpressed by drug stimulation., Particularly in case of LC2/ad,the diversity level of gene abundances between cells wasTable 4.

Predictive drug response models based on ridge regression, were built using expression pro files of cancer cell lines from a publicly available drug screening dataset91, 92to predict response to the drugs., Authors used ComBat to remove the technical variation between the cell line dataset used for training, the drug response predictors,  and single-cell RNA-seq data., Predicted drug response values were substantially correlated with measured sensitivityvalues (0.65). Accordingly by considering high sensitivity predic- tion of cells to Afatinib and Dasatinib and mutually exclusive patterns in the activation status of their signaling pathways in cells, the authors suggested a combination of these two compounds as an ef ficient therapeutic strategy., In vitro validation in 2D and 3D cultured mRCC cells and in vivo validation in subcutaneous xenografts validated the expected additive effect of the drug combination over monotherapy responses., The admin- istration of this combinatorial therapy is inducing superior growth inhibition by co-targeting mutually exclusive EGFR and Src signaling pathways., One of the major weaknesses of Kim et al. s90work is the low number of single cells sequenced. The captured cells may not reflect the true clonality of the patient tumor and might even lead to false discoveries., Recent technological advances in single-cell sequencing made it feasible to capture large numbers of single cells in one experiment., New computational pipelines and approaches have been developed to improve all the steps in processing of the single-cell sequencing data93, 94,  including tackling noise and dropout in these experiments,  normalization techniques, dimensionality reduction9597and clustering approaches98, 99., These rapidly evolving methodologies provide remarkable opportunities for the discovery of biomarkers, predic- tion of ef ficient therapies, and the study of mechanisms of acquiring resistance to treatments.Anchang et al.100were the first to use single-cell perturbation experiments to optimize drug combinations., Their model DRUG-NEM required the speci fication of lineage intracellular commu- nication, and apoptosis markers that were measured in drug perturbation experiments using Mass Cytometry Time-of-Flight (CyTOF)., The objective of the model is to select the minimum number of drugs that creates the maximum perturbation effect on the markers of interest using perturbation data from single-drug experiments., Drug effects were measured using a Bayesian linearmodel to compute the probability that an intracellular commu- nication marker is differentially expressed between treatment and control., A graphical model is then created from these probabilities using a nested effects model and all the possible drug combinations are ranked., This approach is limited by having to know ahead of time which markers to use and this in turn requires knowing the mechanisms of action for the drugs, whichin many cases is not available., Nevertheless this direction for drug response prediction is very promising and will be greatly aided by the burgeoning single cell and drug clonality research., OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES DATA AND DEEP LEARNING The only standardized metric to date for cancer response is RECIST, and it relies on imaging data,  mainly CT and MRI, todetermine how tumors grow or shrink in patients., RECIST can handle up to 10 lesions in the patient prioritized based on the largest lesions, and uses the sum of the lesion diameters (LD) when first measured as the baseline value., In subsequent scans response is categorized into 4 different categories based on how much the sum of LDs has changed, complete response,  partial response,  stable disease,  and progressive disease., There is no suchinternational standard used to measure response for in vitro preclinical models and RECIST is usually not used in in vivo preclinical models due to costs, thus prohibiting fair comparisons between response prediction methods., Furthermore some drug response prediction studies frame the task as regression where continuous values such as IC50 are predicted, and others frame the task as classi fication where a binary value which indicates inhibition or growth is predicted., Reproducibility between cell line based drug response studies remains a challenge due todifferences in viability assays, drug concentrations,  and cell seeding density 101., There is also a need for better data sharing as technical replicates are necessary for estimating within-study variability, yet are sometimes not publicly released102., Addition- ally the studies use a variety of datasets, thereby making quantitative comparisons even less feasible., Instead, qualitative comparisons are made between the methods that consider dataTable 5.

generalization ability, and capacity to model complex biological interactions and chemical interactions., These comparisons are of great practical use as they provide context and scenarios in which one method is likely better than another., The success of deep learning across scienti ficfields followed the collection of large standardized datasets., An additional factor important to broad utilization of deep learning was the growth in available computational power for training these models., Simi-larly successful applications of deep learning in predictiveoncology followed the growth of high-throughput preclinical datasets., This suggests that with additional data from studies that are more reproducible deep learning could provide signi ficant improvements over traditional machine learning methods in drugresponse prediction and drug combination prioritization., Speci fi- cally the end-to-end nature of deep learning allows for extremely effective feature extraction and also enables the integration ofmultiple distinct data modalities., Additionally encoding prior biological knowledge in neural networks can be done via several mechanisms such as graph-convolution networks 103, or condi- tional scaling which allows for multiplicative relations betweenfeatures such as a mutation being required for gene expression levels to be relevant., The nonlinear nature of deep neural networks combined with their inductive bias that allows themto generalize even though they have many more parameters thansamples, suggests that promising applications are possible in pharmacogenomics where complex correlation structures exist among features and between features and labels., For example graph convolutional networks are a promising new way of encoding structural information from molecular graphs 104and can give application-speci fic chemical fingerprints that are more specialized for drug response or combination therapy discovery.Another fruitful direction is the use of transfer learning to leverage an abundance of omics data already available., The main obstacle for transfer learning is the large discrepancies between thetechniques and experimental protocols used for different studieswhich lead to batch effects that violate the assumptions on which deep learning relies to generalize to new datasets., The creation of domain adaptation techniques similar to computer vision 105, speci fic for omics data will be of immense help in enabling transfer learning., Still creating architectures with an effective inductive bias for processing omics data is dif ficult since it is not possible to just rely on the human brain for inspiration like inimage analysis., Thus neural architecture search techniques which remove humans from the design loop by automating the creation and testing of architectures are of key importance in making deeplearning more successful in drug response prediction 106., It has recently been shown that the success of architecture search techniques depends signi ficantly on careful design of the search space107., This requires encoding prior knowledge about poten- tially effective architecture choices which is certainly less dif ficult than specifying an entire architecture, but still remains challen- ging., Deep learning can certainly help in better understanding cancer biology by predicting binding sites or discovering newbiomarkers by analyzing RNA transcripts47, 108, 109., In fact deep learning has also been used to predict protein-protein interac- tions109which are of increasing interest as potential targets for cancer therapies110, so deep learning will have an impact on both drug discovery and drug response prediction., The problem of predicting the optimal treatment or combina- tion of treatments for a cancer patient remains unsolved., Theapproaches reviewed above seek to bring recent advances inmachine learning to bear on this challenge, leveraging the growing high-throughput preclinical screening data and new technologies allowing the pro filing of tumors on a single-cell level., Promising results in this area should encourage both the investigators working on developing cheaper and more precise high-throughput screens to enable further data collection as wellas ML method developers to develop novel tools incorporatingpeculiarities of cancer biology., While there remains much work to be done the field is nascent and offers a path to a truly personalized approach to oncology., Received: 23 August 2019; Accepted: 17 April 2020; REFERENCES 1.
