CREs such as enhancers,  promoters,  and an-chors of chromatin interactions, are predicted to cover 20% 40% of noncoding sequences of the human genome (Kellis et al., 2014). Current methods to annotate CREs in biological samples in- clude ChIP-seq for histone modifications (e.g., H3K4me1, H3K4me3,  and H3K27ac) (Heintzman et al., 2007, 2009; Lupienet al. 2008 Ernst and Kellis 2010),  chromatin binding protein (e.g.,  MED1,  EP300,  CTCF, and ZNF143) (Heintzman et al., 2007; Bailey et al. 2015), or chromatin accessibility assays (e.g., DNase-seq and ATAC-seq) (Thurman et al. 2012; Buenrostro et al. 2013).CREs are unevenly distributed across the genome suggesting dis-tinct biological underpinning to genomic coordinates based on CRE density,  namely, between clusters of CREs (COREs) and indi- vidual CREs., Indeed high CRE density,  such as those reported assuper-enhancers or stretch-enhancers, is associated to cell identityand is bound by transcription regulators with higher intensity than individual CREs (Hnisz et al., 2013; Whyte et al. 2013;Dowen et al. 2014; Boeva et al. 2017). In addition such high-den- sity CRE regions from cancer cells lie proximal to oncogenic driver genes (Loven et al., 2013; Chipumuro et al. 2014; Northcott et al.2014; Kron et al. 2017). Together these features showcase the util-ity of classifying CREs into clusters versus individual CREs., Here we present a new methodology termed clustering of ge- nomic regions analysis method (CREAM) relying on chromatin ac- cessibility profiles, either from DNase-seq or ATAC-seq assays, as aunifying model to identify COREs in any cell type (Fig., 1). CREAMis a computational method relying on unsupervised machine learning that considers the distribution of distances between CREs in a given biological sample to systematically identifyCOREs consisting of at least two individual CREs., By conductinga comprehensive comparative study we introduce CREAM as anew systematic way for the identification of COREs, outperform- ing other widely used CRE annotations,  such as super-enhancers., We compared the enrichment of essential and highly expressedgenes in the proximity of CREAM-identified COREs and individualCREs., We further compare the binding intensity of master tran-scription regulators between COREs and individual CREs., We Corresponding authors ali.madanitonekaboni@mail.utoronto.ca,  bhaibeka@uhnresearch.ca, mlupien@uhnres.utoronto.caArticle published online before print., Article supplemental material,  and publi-cation date are at http, //www.genome.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/gr.248658.119., Freely available online through the Genome Research Open Access option. 2019 Madani Tonekaboni et al.

However the fraction of CREs called within COREs is inde- pendent of the number of individual CREs ( Supplemental Fig., S1C) and does not impact the median width of COREs across cell lines (Spearman s correlation < 0.25) ( Supplemental Fig., S1D ) supporting the specificity of CORE widths with respect to each bi- ological sample irrespective of the total number of CREs., We fur-ther show the ability of COREs to classify samples according totheir tissue of origin using the ENCODE Project Consortium celllines., Our results specifically show that COREs identify the tissue of origin for the 78 DNase I profiles of the ENCODE Project Consortium cell lines with high accuracy (Matthews correlationcoefficient [MCC] of 0.85 for tissues with four or more cell lines)(Supplemental Fig., S1E ). In agreement close to 40% of the 32, 997 COREs found across the ENCODE Project Consortium cell lines are unique to one cell line, and only a very small number are shared across all cell lines ( Supplemental Fig., S2A ). Further- more even COREs common to >50% of cell lines (12% of allCOREs found in the ENCODE Project Consortium cell lines) ( Sup- plemental Fig., S2 ) are not enriched at housekeeping genes ( P-value >0.05) (Hsiao et al. 2001). Collectively, these results emphasize thecell line specificity of COREs. COREs are unique cis-regulatory units of biological significance We next used the DNase-seq data from the ENCODE Project Consortium tier I cell lines (GM12878, K562, and H1-hESC) to fur- ther characterize the biological underpinnings of COREs versus in-dividual CREs., We focused on the ENCODE Project Consortiumtier I cell lines because of their extensive characterization (TheENCODE Project Consortium 2012), inclusive of expression pro- files and DNA protein interactions assessed by ChIP-seq assays, al- lowing for a comprehensive biological assessment of COREsidentified across different cell lines., We first assessed the signal intensity for chromatin accessibil- ity at COREs versus individual CREs., Our results show that COREs have a higher average chromatin accessibility signal per base paircompared with that of individual CREs across the three testedcell lines (GM12878, fold change [FC] = 1.9,  K562,  FC = 8.4,  H1-hESC,  FC = 1.1) (Fig., 2A). We next examined the difference in the expression level of genes proximal to COREs versus those prox- imal to individual CREs., We found that COREs are proximal togenes expressed at higher levels than those near individual CREsin the GM12878, K562,  and H1-hESC cell lines (Wilcoxonsigned-rank test FDR < 0.001,  GM12878,  FC = 4.6,  K562, FC = 6.8,  H1-hESC,  FC = 1.3) (Fig., 2B). Up to 52% 59%, and 39% of COREs overlap with active transcription start sites (TSSs) (TSSs harboringpeaks of chromatin accessibility) in the GM12878, K562,  andH1-hESC cell lines,  respectively ( Supplemental Fig., S2B ). The asso- ciation of COREs compared with individual CREs with highly ex- pressed genes remains significant (FDR < 0.05) even when focusing on COREs distal to TSS (up to 25 kb away from the TSSs, Supple- mental Fig., S3 ) although differences in the expression of genes proximal to COREs and individual CREs decreases with increasing distance (Spearman s correlation <0.8, Fig., 2C). Hence COREs are in proximity of genes with higher expression with respect togenes proximal to individual CREs irrespective of the distanceand overlap between the CREs and gene TSSs., We next assessed the relevance of COREs versus individual CREs in bookmarking genes essential for growth., For this, we Figure 1. Schematic representation of the five main steps of the cluster- ing of genomic regions analysis method (CREAM)., For step 1, CREAM iden-tifies all groups of two, three, four, and more neighboring CREs. The totalnumber of CREs in a group defines its Order. Step 2 is identification of the maximum window size ( MWS ) between two neighboring CREs in group for each Order., The MWS corresponds to the greatest distance al- lowed between two neighboring CREs in a given cluster., Step 3 is identifi-cation of the maximum Order limit of COREs from a given data set. Step 4is CORE reporting according to the criteria set in step 3 from the highest tothe lowest Order. Step 5 is identification of the minimum Order limit ofCOREs based on the identified COREs in step 4.Madani Tonekaboni et al., 1734 Genome Research www.genome.org combined the CRISPR/Cas9 gene essentiality screen data reported in the K562 cell line (Wang et al., 2015) with CORE identificationfrom the K562 cell line revealing the enrichment of gene essentialfor growth proximal to COREs (FDR < 0.001 using permutation test) (Fig., 2D). This is exemplified at the BCR gene that is the most essential gene and proximal to a CORE in K562 chronic my-elogenous leukemia (CML) cell line (Fig., 2D) positive for the BCR- ABL gene fusion reported in CML (Ren 2005), By extending our analysis to essentiality scores from other cell lines tested by Wang et al., (2015) we show that the essentiality score of genes proximal to K562 COREs is less in the KBM-7, Jiyoye,  and Rajicell lines compared with the K562 cell line (FDR < 0.001) (Fig.2E)., We further show that the expression of genes essential for growth in K562 proximal to COREs is higher than the expression of essential genes associated with individual CREs (FDR < 0.001)(Fig., 2F). These results support the cell-type specific nature of COREs and their association with essential genes and argue in fa-vor of COREs accounting for a greater regulatory potential relevant to cell type essentiality than individual CREs.CREAM identifies COREs bound by master transcription regulators Transcription regulators (TRs) bind CREs to modulate the expression of cell-type  specific gene expression patterns., Quan- tifying the binding intensity of transcrip-tion regulators over COREs in theGM12878 K562, and H1-hESC cell linesreveals that >20% of ChIP-seq data of transcription regulators (GM12878, 92/ 237,  K562,  256/325,  H1-hESC, 24/119)show binding intensity higher overCOREs compared with individual CREs when normalizing the ChIP-seq signal over COREs to the size of each CORE(FC > 2, FDR < 0.001) (Fig., 3A). The high-er enrichment of TR binding intensity inCOREs can be also seen using COREs ex- cluding the CRE-free gaps ( Supplemental Fig., S4A ) regardless of whether COREs overlap active TSSs (TSSs harboring peaksof chromatin accessibility) or not ( Sup- plemental Fig., S4B ). This higher tran- scription regulator binding intensity at COREs is showcased in GM12878by the master transcription regulatorsTCF3 and EBF1 (Somasundaram et al.2015)., Specifically we observed a greater than threefold difference in binding in- tensity for TCF3 and EBF1 in theGM12878 cell line over COREs comparedwith individual CREs (Fig., 3B), exempli-fied at the CORE proximal to the ZFAT gene (Fig. 3C). Similarly, the master tran- scription regulators GABPA and CREB1(Shankar et al. 2005; Yang et al. 2013)bind with a more than threefold greater intensity over COREs compared with in- dividual CREs in the K562 cell line (Fig.3B), exemplified at the CORE overlap-ping the LMBR1 , NOM1 ,  and MNX1 genes (Fig., 3C). Finally in the H1-hESC cell line, the master transcription regulators NANOG and MYC (Pan and Thomson 2007) bind with higher intensity at COREs(FC > 1.2, FDR < 0.001) (Fig., 3B) in the H1-hESC cell line, exempli-fied at the HOXA locus CORE (Fig. 3C). CTCF- and cohesin-enriched COREs map to topologically associated domain boundaries Beyond COREs the human genome can be partitioned in various clusters including those based on contact frequencies between dis- tal genomic coordinates that define topologically associated do-mains (TADs) (Ea et al., 2015). To assess the relation betweenCOREs and TADs we integrated the distribution of COREs with TADs reported from Hi-C data in the GM12878 and K562 cell lines (Rao et al., 2014). Our analysis reveals higher fraction of COREscompared with individual CREs at TAD boundaries (permutationtest FDR < 0.001) (Fig., 4A,B; Supplemental Fig. S5A ). Similar results are seen in the HeLa, HMEC, HUVEC, and NHEK cell lines ( Supplemental Fig. S5B ; Rao et al. 2014; Ea et al. 2015). B AC E DF Figure 2.

()P-value <0.01.Systematic CORE identification Genome Research 1735 www.genome.org Together this suggests that COREs are preferentially found at TAD boundaries., CTCF cohesin (RAD21 and SMC3),  YY1, and the ZNF143 transcription regulators preferentially bind chromatin at anchors of chromatin interactions, inclusive of TAD boundaries (Heidari et al., 2014; Rao et al. 2014; Bailey et al. 2015; Weintraub et al.2017). We therefore assessed whether these transcription regula-tors were enriched within COREs at TAD boundaries based on theirChIP-seq signal intensity., CTCF and RAD21 were preferentially en- riched within COREs compared with individual CREs restricted to TAD boundaries in both the GM12878 and K562 cell lines (FC >1.5 for both COREs and individual CREs, FC at COREs morethan 1.5 times the FC at individual CREs) (Fig., 4C). No enrichmentover COREs at TAD boundaries was seen for ZNF143 and YY1 or for any of the 82 and 94 additional transcription regulators with ChIP-seq data in the GM12878 and K562 cell lines, res-pectively., Together this argues that CTCF and cohesin behavedifferently from all other transcription regulators at TAD boundar- ies, mapping more to COREs as opposed to individual CREs.Furthermore, we show that CTCF and cohesin bind at TAD-boundary COREs with higher intensity than at intra-TADCOREs, defined as COREs within TADsfound 10 kb away from boundaries, in both the GM12878 and K562 cell lines (FC > 2,  FDR < 0.001 for CTCF and RAD21,  FC > 1.7, FDR < 0.001 for SMC3in GM12878 and K562 respectively)(Fig., 4D). ZNF143 also preferentially oc-cupied TAD-boundary COREs as opposed to intra-TAD COREs but only in the K562 cell line (FC = 1.42, FDR < 0.001) (Fig.4D)., We observed lesser differences inthe binding intensity of YY1 at TAD-boundary COREs versus intra-TAD COREs in the GM12878 and K562 cell lines (FC < 1.25 in both cell lines) (Fig.4D)., Extending this analysis to the re-maining ChIP-seq data for transcription regulators in the GM12878 and K562 cell lines (The ENCODE Project Consor-tium 2012) revealed 69% and 35% oftranscription regulators with increasedbinding intensity at TAD-boundary COREs versus intra-TAD COREs but with low effect size in the GM12878and K562 cell lines, respectively (FC > 1, FDR < 0.001) (Fig., 4D). The enrichment of CTCF and cohe- sin within COREs at TAD boundaries led us to assess if they were themselves form-ing homotypic clusters of transcriptionregulator binding regions (HCTs) (Goteaet al., 2010) at TAD boundaries. Using CREAM on the 86 and 98 ChIP-seq data from the GM12878 and K562 cell linesrespectively, identified 41 and 59 tran-scription regulators in each cell line forming at least 100 HCTs ( Supplemental Table S1 )., Comparing the distribution of HCT at TAD boundaries versus intra-TADs revealed that >50% of CTCF RAD21,  SMC3,  and ZNF143 HCTs lie at TAD boundaries (Fig., 4E), exemplified at the MYC andBCL6 gene loci (Fig. 4F). This con- trasts with other transcription regulators such as SP1 and GATA2with <10% of HCTs mapping to TAD boundaries in the GM12878and K562 cell lines, respectively (Fig., 4E). The differences in frac-tion of HCTs at TAD boundaries is not biased to the GC content of the individual binding regions within HCTs ( Supplemental Fig., S5C ). Taken together these results suggest that clusters of CTCF and cohesin binding regions establishing HCTs are preferen-tially found at TAD boundaries., COREs and super-enhancers are two distinct biological features of cells Similar to COREs super-enhancers were introduced as high-signal intensity regions identified from ChIP-seq data from features, suchas H3K27ac or MED1,  typical of a subset of CREs, including pro-moters and enhancers (Hnisz et al., 2013; Loven et al. 2013; Vahedi et al. 2015). Although the concept of clusters of CREs B A C Figure 3. Transcription regulator (TR) binding intensity in individual CREs and COREs.

We therefore comprehensively compared CORE identifi- cation by CREAM with super-enhancer mapping from ROSE using the data from the GM12878, K562,  and H1-hESC cell lines., Our comparison of super-enhancers identified either by ROSE or its latest version (ROSE2) (Stratton et al., 2016 https, //github.com/linlabbcm/rose2), with COREs revealed limited over- lap in all the three cell lines (Jaccard index <0.5) (Fig., 5A). Moreover the pathway enrichment analysis based on genes with-in 10 kb of COREs or super-enhancers shows higher enrichment ofphenotypic-specific pathways for COREs., For instance enrich-ment for the B CELL RECEPTOR SIGNALING PATHWAY term is 2.6-fold more significant based on COREs as opposed to super- enhancers found in the lymphoblastoid GM12878 cell line(Fig., 5B). Similarly the CHRONIC MYELOID LEUKEMIA term is 3.07-fold more enriched in genes proximal to COREs compared with super-enhancer in the chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cell line (Fig., 5B). Finally the WNT SIGNALING PATHWAY term is 2.36-fold more enriched in genes proximal to COREs comparedwith super-enhancers in the H1 human embryonic stem cell line(Fig., 5B). We further compared the structure of COREs and super-en- hancers according to their proportion reported to harbor two ormore CREs., Although all COREs consisted of at least two CREs be-tween 75% and 90% of super-enhancers identified by ROSE werecomposed of at least two CREs in the GM12878, K562,  and H1-hESC cell lines (Fig., 5C). This number plummets to <65% for super-enhancers called by ROSE2 in these same cell lines (Fig.5C). This argues for a greater similarity between COREs andsuper-enhancers identified by ROSE than ROSE2. We next com-pared the relationship between gene expression versus COREs and super-enhancers. Our results reveal the higher expression of genes located in proximity to both COREs and super-enhancers, called either using ROSE or ROSE2, as opposed to genes exclusivelyproximal to COREs or super-enhancers in the GM12878 and K562 cell lines (Fig., 5D). Similarly in the H1-hESC cell line, genes com- monly assigned to COREs and super-enhancers called by ROSEshow higher expression compared with genes assigned uniquelyto either COREs or super-enhancers (FDR < 0.001) (Fig., 5D) butthis does not apply to super-enhancers called by ROSE2, in which CREAM alone serves to identify COREs near genes with the highest level of expression (FDR < 0.001) (Fig., 5D). Moreover the expression of CORE-specific genes was higher in the GM12878 and K562 cell lines compared with genes exclu-sively in proximity of ROSE or ROSE2 super-enhancers (FDR < 0.001) (Fig., 5D). Regarding H1-hESC the expression of CORE-spe- cific genes was higher than ROSE2-specific genes (FDR < 0.001)(Fig., 5D) but lower than ROSE-specific genes (FDR < 0.001; Fig.5D). Expanding our analysis to genes essential for growth in theK562 cell lines revealed that genes located in proximity of both COREs and super-enhancers have the highest enrichment for essential genes, followed by genes only proximal to COREs and,  fi-nally, genes only proximal to super-enhancers (Fig., 5E). Collective-ly these results show a level of similarity between COREs andsuper-enhancers and also highlight differences in which COREs are more associated with biological functions than super-enhanc- ers., This argues that COREs identified using CREAM are a more pre-cise reflection of cellular identity and function.As a final comparison, we assessed the enrichment of tran- scription regulators according to their ChIP-seq profiles within COREs versus super-enhancers., Our analysis reveals that >60% oftranscription regulators are enriched in COREs compared withROSE-super-enhancers in the GM12878 and H1-hESC cell lines(FC > 2 and FDR < 0.001) (Fig., 5F). In the K562 cell line >30% of transcription regulators are more enriched in COREs compared with ROSE-super-enhancers (FC > 2 and FDR < 0.001) (Fig., 5F). Incontrast <2% of transcription regulators are more enriched inROSE-super-enhancers compared with COREs in any of the threecell lines (Fig., 5F). Similar results are obtained with comparing COREs to ROSE2-super-enhancers in the H1-hESC cell line with lower enrichment reported in GM12878 and K562 cell lines (FC> 2 and FDR < 0.001) (Fig., 5F). CTCF and the cohesin complexare among the transcription regulators preferentially enriched inCOREs as opposed to super-enhancers in each cell line tested., This led us to assess the enrichment of CTCF at COREs versus su- per-enhancers located at TAD boundaries, inclusive of a 10-kb win-dow around these boundaries., Our analysis revealed the strongbinding intensity of CTCF within COREs at TAD boundaries as well as weaker binding intensity within super-enhancers at TAD boundaries, in the GM12878 and K562 cell lines (FDR < 0.001)(Fig., 5G). Collectively these results support the unique biologicalnature of COREs compared with super-enhancers toward chroma-tin looping factors and TAD boundaries, of relevance to the three- dimensional organization of the genome., Clinical utility of CREAM to identify COREs discriminating tumor type and underpinning biological pathway CRE identification on the human genome assembly GRCh38/hg38 was recently completed through ATAC-seq assays in 400 human tu- mor samples from 23 different cancer types part of The CancerGenome Atlas (TCGA) (Corces et al., 2018). Using the k-nearest neighbor method ( k= 3) on the COREs identified by CREAM classi- fied these TCGA ATAC-seq profiles according to their tumor type (MCC = 0.86) (Fig., 6A). Out of 22 cancer types with more than four patient samples with available ATAC-seq profiles 17 had ba-lanced accuracy of >85% (Fig., 6A). We found that in patient tumorATAC-seq profiles, COREs were located in proximity of genes withhigher expression than individual CREs (Fig., 6B) and were overrep- resented in 49 out of 50 hallmarks of cancer gene sets (FDR < 0.05) (Fig. 6C; Liberzon et al. 2015). The TNF-SIGNALING VIA NF- B hallmark gene set was enriched for almost all of the TCGA samples whereas other hallmark gene sets were tissue specifically enriched, such as the ANDROGEN RESPONSE hallmark gene set enriched in prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) tumor samples (Fig., 6C). Altogether our results show the potential utility of COREs in clini-cal setting to discriminate cancer types and identify hallmark genesets within each tumor sample of biological relevance., Discussion Although the concept that CREs are not all equal is well estab-lished their classification into clusters is recent and warrants thedevelopment of strategies for their classification according to the various approaches developed to map CREs., Here we developed CREAM as the first unsupervised machine learning method pro-viding a systematic approach to set the filters through an iterativelearning process to identify COREs from chromatin accessibilityprofiles generated in any cell type., We show that CREAM identifies COREs that have higher transcription regulator binding intensityMadani Tonekaboni et al., 1738 Genome Research www.genome.org E F GBA C D Figure 5.

These COREs are preferentially bound by a limited number of transcription regulators namely,  CTCF, thecohesin complex (RAD21,  SMC3),  and,  to a lesser extent, ZNF143., These are transcription regulators previously shown toregulate contact frequencies between distal genomic coordinates defining the three-dimensional organization of the genomeB A C Figure 6., Biology of COREs in human tumor samples.

We further showed that COREs are distinct from super-en- hancers defined by ROSE and ROSE2 when relying on DNase-seqdata (of note, ROSE and ROSE2 were designed for identifying su-per-enhancers based on H3K27ac ChIP-seq data)., Specifically COREs show higher enrichment of biological pathways associated with phenotype of each cell type., Moreover COREs comparedwith super-enhancers show higher enrichment in proximity ofhighly expressed and essential genes in binding of transcriptionregulators and association to CTCF-enriched regions at TAD boundaries., Finally we reveal the clinical value of CORE identification in 400 tumor samples to delineate their cancer type and enriched bi-ological pathways based on genes proximal to COREs in each sam-ple., In the process we also provide the first pan-cancer CORE data set from 400 publicly released chromatin accessibility profiles (Corces et al., 2018) covering 23 distinct human cancer types.Overall our results support the relevance of CREAM to classifyCREs into COREs, and show the value of COREs,  independently on genome assembly version, to delineate the biology unique to any sample profiled for its chromatin accessibility., Methods Statistical analysis of this paper has been conducted in R version 3.5.1 (R Core Team 2018). CREAM CREAM uses genome-wide maps of CREs in the tissue or cell typeof interest generated from chromatin-based assays such DNase-seq and ATAC-seq., CREs can be identified from these data by peak call- ing tools such as MACS (Zhang et al. 2008). The called individualCREs then will be used as input of CREAM. Hence, CREAM does not need the signal intensity files (BAM, FASTQ) as input. CREAM considers proximity of the CREs within each sample to ad-just parameters of inclusion of CREs into a CORE in the following steps (Fig., 1). Step 1 grouping of individual CREs throughout the genome CREAM initially groups neighboring individual CREs through-out the genome., Each group can have different number of individ- ual CREs. Then it categorizes the groups based on their includedCRE numbers. We defined Order ( O) for each group as its includ- ed CRE number. In the next step CREAM identifies the maximum allowed distance between individual CREs for calling a group as CORE of a given O., Step 2 maximum window size identification We defined maximum window size ( MWS ) as the maximum al- lowed distance between individual CREs included in a CORE., For each O CREAM estimates a distribution of window sizes as the maximum distance between individual CREs in all groups of that Owithin the genome., Afterward MWS will be identified based on the low stringent outlier threshold as follows, MWS =Q1(log ( WS))1.5IQ(log ( WS)), where MWS is the maximum allowed distance between neighbor- ing individual CREs within a CORE., Q1(log[ WS]) and IQ(log[ WS]) are the first quartile and interquartile of distribution of window siz- es (Fig., 1).Step 3 maximum Order identification After determining MWS for each Order of COREs, CREAM identi- fies the maximum O(Omax) for the given sample., Increasing the Oof COREs results in the gain of information within the clusters allowing the individual CREs to have further distance from eachother., Hence starting from COREs of O= 2, the Oincreases up to a plateau at which an increase of Odoes not result in an increase inMWS., This threshold is considered as the Omax for COREs with- in the given sample. Step 4 CORE calling CREAM starts to identify COREs from the Omax down to O=2 .F o r each O, it calls groups with window size less than MWS as COREs., As a result, many COREs with lower Os are clustered within COREs with higher Os. Therefore remaining lower OCOREs,  for example,  O= 2 or 3, have individual CREs with a distance close to MWS (Fig., 1). These clusters could have been identified as COREs because of the initial distribution of MWS derived mainly by COREs of the same Othat are clustered in COREs of higher Os., Hence, CREAM eliminates these low OCOREs as follows. Step 5 minimum Order identification COREs that contain individual CREs with a distance close to MWS can be identified as COREs owing to the high skewness in the ini- tial distribution of MWS ., To avoid reporting these COREs CREAM filters out the clusters with ( O<Omin) that do not follow mono- tonic increase of maximum distance between individual CREs ver- susO(Fig., 1). CREAM starts from the lowest order ( O= 2) and checks changes of ( MWSmedian[ WS])/median( WS) where WS is the distribution of maximum distance between individualCREs within COREs of that order., Then CREAM filters out called COREs with Order = 2 up to the point at which this parameter (MWSmedian[ WS])/median( WS),  is decreasing by increasing order., Association with genes A gene is considered associated with a CRE or a CORE if found within a 10-kb window from each other., This distance was cho- sen to avoid a false-positive association of elements with gene TSSs based on previous reports (Sanyal et al., 2012). Expressionsof genes with respect to distance of COREs and individual CREs with gene TSSs were conducted for different distances from 1- kb up to 25-kb windows as suggested by Sanyal et al., (2012). Association with essential genes The number of genes that are in 10-kb proximity of COREs andare essential in the K562 cell line are identified (Wang et al.2015)., This number is then compared with the number of essential genes in 10 000 randomly selected (permuted) genes,  among the genes included in the essentiality screen., This comparison isused to compute FDR as the number of false discoveries in permu- tation test, and z-score regarding the significance of enrichment of essential genes among genes in 10-kb proximity of COREs iden- tified for the K562 cell line., Gene expression comparison RNA sequencing profiles of the GM12878 K562,  and H1-hESC cell lines, available in the ENCODE Project Consortium database (The ENCODE Project Consortium 2012), are used to identify expres- sion of genes in proximity of individual CREs and COREs., The ex- pression of genes is compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank test.Systematic CORE identification Genome Research 1741 www.genome.org Gene expression enrichment in TCGA The expression of genes associated with COREs of each tumor sam- ple in TCGA was compared with the expression of 100 randomly selected gene sets, with the same number of genes., The Z-score is calculated considering the null distribution generated relying onthe average gene expression in the random gene sets., The P-values were calculated by comparing the expression of genes associated with COREs with genes associated with individual CREs using Wilcoxon signed-rank test., Pathway enrichment analysis A hypergeometric test was used to identify P-values for enrichment of hallmark gene sets using the dhyper function in the stats R pack- age., CORE-associated genes for each sample and a catalog of genes associated with peaks were used as the query and background genelists, respectively., Housekeeping genes The list of genes within the HSIAO_HOUSEKEEPING_GENES geneset (Hsiao et al. 2001) was used as the housekeeping genes. Transcription regulator and input signal binding enrichment bedGraph files of ChIP-seq data of transcription regulators are overlapped with the identified COREs and individual CREs in the GM12878, K562,  and H1-hESC cell line using BEDTools (ver-sion 2.23.0) (Quinlan and Hall 2010)., The resulting signals were summed over all the individual CREs or COREs and then normal- ized to the total genomic coverage of individual CREs or COREs, respectively., These normalized transcription regulator binding in- tensities are used for comparing TR binding intensity in individualCREs and COREs (Fig., 4). A Wilcoxon signed-rank test is used for this comparison. Similar analysis is used for enrichment of transcriptional reg- ulators, to get overlap of DNase I signal data of the cell lines within individual CREs and COREs., The overlapped signal then normal-ized to the size of COREs and individual CREs. The distributions of these normalized signal per base within COREs and individual CREs were then compared for a given cell line., We included the DNase I ChIP-seq, and gene expression pro- files available from all three tier I cell lines from the ENCODE Project Consortium (GM12878, K562, and H1-hESC) to provide a comprehensive analysis of COREs versus biochemical measure- ments across a diverse collection of cell types, acknowledgingthat differences in the significance in trends across cell lines could arise from cell-type specific biology or variability in the quality of data between cell types., Sample similarity Similarity between two samples from the ENCODE Project Consortium or TCGA data sets was identified relying on the Jaccard index for the commonality of their identified COREs throughout the genome., Then this Jaccard index is used as the sim- ilarity statistics in a three-nearest-neighbor classification ap-proach., We assess the performance of the classification using leave-one-out cross-validation. We used Matthews correlation co- efficient for performance of the classification model (Smirnov et al., 2016). The phenotype of each tissue is considered as a class and the obtained vector is used to calculate MCC using the imple-mented MCC function in PharmacoGx package in R (Smirnov et al., 2016). In this classification scheme we considered the phe- notype of the closest sample to an out of pool sample as its phenotype.Multiple hypothesis correction P-values were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (McDonald 2009)., Software availability CREAM is publicly available as an open source R package (https // cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html) on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (https, //CRAN.R-project.org/package=CREAM) and as Supplemental Code ., Acknowledgments DNase I sequencing profile of the HeLa cell line is used in this re- search.

      "question": "What is the main objective of the research in this paper?",
      "answer": "The main objective of the research in this paper is to develop a computational method, termed CREAM (clustering of genomic regions analysis method), for the systematic identification of clusters of cis-regulatory elements (CREs), referred to as clusters of regulatory elements (COREs). The study aims to address the challenges in identifying these clusters from chromatin accessibility profiles, thereby enhancing the understanding of the biological significance of COREs in defining cellular identity and lineage-specific regulatory networks. Additionally, the research demonstrates the clinical utility of CREAM in stratifying tumor samples according to cancer type and identifying cancer type-specific active biological pathways. Overall, the paper emphasizes the importance of COREs in understanding gene regulation and their potential application in cancer research."

      "question": "Can you summarize the abstract of the paper?",
      "answer": "The abstract of the paper discusses the development of a novel unsupervised machine learning approach called CREAM (clustering of genomic regions analysis method) for identifying clusters of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) known as COREs. These COREs are significant for understanding cell-type specific gene expression and are linked to transcriptional regulation. The study highlights the challenges in detecting COREs due to the uneven distribution of CREs across the genome and the limitations of existing methods. CREAM automates the detection of COREs from chromatin accessibility profiles, focusing on regions enriched with CREs that are bound by master transcription regulators and are near essential genes. The findings indicate that COREs are distinct from super-enhancers, particularly in their genomic distribution and structure, and they are enriched at topologically associated domain (TAD) boundaries. The clinical utility of CREAM is demonstrated through its application to over 400 tumor samples, effectively stratifying them by cancer type and identifying relevant biological pathways. Overall, the results support the use of CREAM for accurately delineating the biological underpinnings of cell identity across various normal and cancer cell types."

      "question": "Describe the methodology used in the paper.",
      "answer": "The methodology used in the paper \"Identifying clusters of cis-regulatory elements underpinning TAD structures and lineage-specific regulatory networks\" involves the development of a novel computational approach called the Clustering of Genomic Regions Analysis Method (CREAM). This methodology is designed to systematically identify clusters of cis-regulatory elements (CREs), referred to as clusters of regulatory elements (COREs), from chromatin accessibility profiles obtained through techniques such as DNase-seq or ATAC-seq.\n\nThe CREAM methodology consists of five iterative learning steps:\n\n1. **Grouping of Individual CREs**: CREAM begins by grouping neighboring individual CREs throughout the genome. Each group can contain a varying number of individual CREs, which are categorized based on their count, referred to as \"Order\" (O).\n\n2. **Maximum Window Size Identification**: For each Order, CREAM estimates a maximum window size (MWS), which defines the maximum allowed distance between individual CREs within a CORE. This is determined using a statistical approach to identify outliers in the distribution of distances between CREs.\n\n3. **Maximum Order Identification**: CREAM identifies the maximum Order of COREs (Omax) for the given sample. This step involves determining the point at which increasing the Order does not yield additional information regarding the clustering of CREs.\n\n4. **CORE Calling**: Starting from Omax and moving down to O=2, CREAM identifies groups of CREs that meet the distance criteria defined by the MWS as COREs. This step allows for the identification of clusters of CREs that are functionally relevant.\n\n5. **Minimum Order Identification**: To ensure the robustness of the identified COREs, CREAM filters out those with low Orders that do not follow a monotonic increase in distance with increasing Order. This filtering process helps eliminate potential false positives.\n\nThe methodology also includes the association of identified COREs with genes, where a gene is considered associated with a CORE if it is found within a 10-kb window from the CORE. This association is further analyzed to assess the expression levels of genes proximal to COREs compared to those near individual CREs.\n\nAdditionally, the paper highlights the clinical utility of CREAM by applying it to chromatin accessibility profiles from over 400 tumor samples to stratify them according to cancer type and identify cancer-specific biological pathways.\n\nOverall, CREAM is presented as a systematic and unsupervised machine learning method that enhances the identification of COREs, providing insights into the regulatory landscape of the genome and its implications in cellular identity and cancer biology."

This is determined by estimating a distribution of window sizes for each Order and identifying MWS based on a low stringent outlier threshold.\n\n3. **Maximum Order Identification**: After determining the MWS for each Order of COREs, CREAM identifies the maximum Order (Omax) for the given sample. This step helps in understanding how many individual CREs can be included in a CORE while maintaining relevant biological information.\n\n4. **CORE Calling**: CREAM then identifies COREs starting from the highest Order down to the lowest (O=2). It calls groups as COREs if their window size is less than the MWS.\n\n5. **Minimum Order Identification**: Finally, CREAM filters out low Order COREs that do not follow a monotonic increase of maximum distance between individual CREs versus Order, ensuring that only relevant and significant COREs are reported.\n\nThese steps ensure that the data is systematically processed to identify biologically meaningful clusters of CREs, enhancing the accuracy of the findings related to cell-type specific biological underpinnings."

      "question": "Are there any contradictions between this paper's findings and previous research?",
      "answer": "Based on the content of the research paper, there are several points of comparison with previous research that could indicate contradictions or differences in findings:\n\n1. **Identification of Regulatory Elements**: The paper introduces a new methodology, CREAM, for identifying clusters of cis-regulatory elements (COREs) and emphasizes its superiority over existing methods for identifying super-enhancers. Previous studies have established the concept of super-enhancers, but the authors argue that COREs provide a more accurate reflection of cellular identity and function. This suggests a contradiction in the perceived utility and biological significance of super-enhancers versus COREs.\n\n2. **Distribution and Binding of Transcription Regulators**: The findings indicate that COREs are preferentially bound by specific transcription regulators (CTCF and cohesin) at TAD boundaries, contrasting with the binding patterns observed for super-enhancers. Previous research may not have emphasized this distinction, which could imply that the understanding of transcription factor binding dynamics needs to be reevaluated in light of the new findings presented in this paper.\n\n3. **Association with Essential Genes**: The paper reports that COREs are more closely associated with essential genes than individual CREs, and this association is stronger than what has been previously documented for super-enhancers. This could contradict earlier studies that may have suggested a more uniform association of super-enhancers with essential genes across various contexts.\n\n4. **Clinical Utility**: The authors claim that COREs can effectively stratify tumor samples according to cancer type and delineate specific biological pathways, which may challenge previous methodologies that relied on super-enhancers for similar classifications. This suggests that the clinical relevance of COREs may be greater than that of super-enhancers, which could contradict findings from studies that have focused on super-enhancers in cancer research.\n\n5. **Pathway Enrichment Analysis**: The paper presents evidence that COREs are more enriched in phenotypic-specific pathways compared to super-enhancers, which could contradict earlier assumptions about the functional roles of super-enhancers in driving cell identity and disease states.\n\nOverall, the findings of this paper suggest a re-evaluation of the roles and definitions of cis-regulatory elements, particularly in distinguishing between COREs and super-enhancers, and highlight the need for further research to reconcile these differences with existing literature."
