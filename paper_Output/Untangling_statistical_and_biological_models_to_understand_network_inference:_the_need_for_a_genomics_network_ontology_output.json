STATISTICAL PERSPECTIVE The first perspective we describe in this paper is the statistical perspective ., By this we mean any approach that applies a sta- tistical inference method to a gene expression data set in orderto draw conclusions about the biochemical interactions betweengenes and gene products without requiring further constraintsor assumptions, e.g.,  regarding the underlying biological mech-anisms., The result of such an approach can be used to makepredictions about the interactions of genes and gene products forconstructing a network representation of the biochemical interac-tions., For reasons of clarity, we provide an explicit definition forthe resulting network. Definition 1. A network that has been inferred from gene expres- sion data by the application of a statistical inference method is called a gene regulatory network., In this network nodescorrespond to genes or gene products and edges correspond to www.frontiersin.org August 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 299 |1 Emmert-Streib et al., Gene regulatory networks biochemical interactions of any type. The network can be directed or undirected. For this definition we used the term gene regulatory network (GRN) because it is frequently used ( Wang et al.,  2006, Hecker et al.,  2009 )., However for reasons of completeness,  we would like to note that in the literature, there are also various alternativenotations used instead of GRN ( Haibe-Kains and Emmert-Streib, 2014 ),  but for the following discussion the nomenclature is not of relevance., 2.1. PURPOSE OF THE STATISTICAL PERSPECTIVE From the above definition one can see that a statistical perspectiveis very general as it does not require biological information of anykind about the underlying mechanisms within a biological cell.Instead, biological information can be gained from the inferenceprocess about the biochemical interactions., Now the question is what type(s) of biochemical interac- tion(s) can be identified by statistical network inference methods?T h ea n s w e rt ot h i sq u e s t i o ni sa c t u a l l yo n l yp a r t i a l l yg i v e nb ythe data type used for the inference., Since the inference is basedon gene expression data which provide information about theabundance of mRNAs only rather than binding information of, e.g.,  a transcription factor to a promoter region or protein-protein binding, gene regulatory networks defined in the abovesense provide information about general regulatory interactions between regulators and their potential targets, gene-gene inter-actions,  and potential protein-protein interactions (e.g., in acomplex) ( de Matos Simoes et al.,  2013 )., In other words if a network inference method predicts the interaction betweentwo genes or gene products then there is no systematic way tofind out which particular biochemical interaction type this is, due to the nature of gene expression data., Hence, this is nota shortcoming of any network inference method, but the datathemselves. In brief the purpose of the statistical perspective is to make predictions regarding the presence of interactions and directionsof interactions within gene regulatory networks., However such amethod or its components are not required to have a meaningfulbiological interpretation (in contrast, see Section 3.1) in the sensethat these emulate,  e.g.,  a biological process., 2.2. METHODS FOR INFERRING GENE REGULATORY NETWORKS T h e r ea r em a n ye x a m p l e sw h e r es u c hn e t w o r k sh a v eb e e ns t u d -ied ( Margolin et al., 2006,  Werhli et al.,  2006,  Meyer et al.,  2008,  Stolovitzky et al.,  2009, Emmert-Streib et al.,  2012 ),  see Ta b l e 1 for a brief overview of some widely used methods., All of thesemethods have in common that they estimate statistical inde- pendence relations for random variables, by different inference approaches,  to construct a GRN component-wise., 2.3. WHO USES THE STATISTICAL PERSPECTIVE The statistical perspective is the preferred approach in computa-tional biology, computational genomics,  biostatistics and bioin-formatics, where the goal is to extract (infer) information from agiven data set to predict population aspects of its.T able 1 | A brief overview of statistical network inference methods that have been introduced in recent years (first column) and the keymethods (second column) on which the inference algorithms arebased on to estimate interactions., Name Method References Aracne Mutual information DPI Margolin et al., 2006 C3Net Maximal mutual information Altay and Emmert-Streib, 2010 BC3Net Bagging C3Net de Matos Simoes and Emmert-Streib, 2012 ENNET Gradient boosting Slawek and Arodz,  2013 GENIE3 Regression Huynh-Thu et al., 2010 GGM Full partial correlation Wille et al., 2004 MRNet Conditional mutual information M e y e re ta l ., ,2 0 0 8 NIMEFI Ensemble feature importance methods Ruyssinck et al., 2014 3. MATHEMATICAL MODELING PERSPECTIVE In a molecular biological context which is our focus, the mathe- matical modeling perspective aims to provide a realistic model for the transcription of DNA into RNA and the translation of RNAinto proteins., However, there are also simpler models that focuson the former part only. In general, the detail level of such modelsvaries considerably (see Section 3.2). 3.1. PURPOSE OF THE MODELING PERSPECTIVE The purpose of the mathematical modeling perspective is toincrease our understanding of dynamical properties of a systemand to derive behavioral features thereof that can then be usedfor making predictions about a natural system., This is possiblebecause usually, such a system is meant to form a mechanis-tic model of a natural (biological) system or process., Seminalmodels in this context are for instance the model of a neuron(Hodgkin and Huxley 1952 ), a heart ( NOBLE,  1960 )o re n z y m e kinetics ( Schnell and Mendoza,  1997 )., Simply put the purpose of a mathematical model is to emulate a natural system as good aspossible with respect to its dynamical activity., Additionally, evenits components have a meaningful biological interpretation. 3.2. METHODS TO MODEL TRANSCRIPTION REGULATION Over the last years many different models have been intro-duced to model the transcription regulation of genes ( Gardner and Faith, 2005,  Karlebach and Shamir,  2008,  Ribeiro,  2008 )., These models vary on e.g.,  the level of their detail complexity, the closeness to biological reality or the time complexity of thesimulations., Among the first and simplest approaches to models of GRNs are Boolean Networks and Probabilistic Boolean Networks(Kauffman, 1993,  Shmulevich et al.,  2002 ),  see Ta b l e 2 ., These models assume a discrete activity level of genes, which canbe either on (1) or off (0). For this reason such models arecalled logical models . Discrete Boolean Networks and Probabilistic Boolean Networks provide a simplistic representation of the Frontiers in Genetics | Statistical Genetics and Methodology August 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 299 |2 Emmert-Streib et al., Gene regulatory networks T able 2 | A brief overview of some mathematical modeling methods that are used to model the transcription regulation of genes., T ype Model References Logical model Boolean network Kauffman 1993 Logical model Probabilistic Boolean network Shmulevich et al., 2002 Continuous model Ordinary differential equations Chen et al., 2004 Continuous model Michaelis-Menten and Hill kinetics Van den Bulcke et al., 2006 Single molecule Gillespies stochastic simulation algorithmGillespie, 1976 Single molecule Approximate SSA Ribeiro et al., 2006 transcriptional activity rather than a detailed biological formu- lation of molecular processes., Models allowing to simulate a continuous gene activity dynamics are e.g., systems of coupled ordinary differential equa-tions (ODEs) or the Gillespies stochastic simulation algorithm(SSA)., Different models in this category can be distinguishedbased on the biological details that are modeled., The two majormodel categories focus either on transcription regulation or tran-scription and translation events., Hence the latter model type isclosest with respect to the phenomenologically observable bio-logical mechanisms., Another difference between these models isif the average activity of a population of cells is simulated or theactivity of a single cell ( Ribeiro et al., 2006,  Kandhavelu et al.,  2012 )., 3.3. WHO USES THE MATHEMATICAL MODELING PERSPECTIVE The mathematical modeling perspective is very popular in mathematical biology, theoretical biology,  systems biology, biochemistry and biophysics., 4. COMPARISON OF THE TWO PERSPECTIVES InFigure 1 we show a schematic overview and a comparison of the statistical perspective (red box) and the mathematical model-ing perspective (blue box), discussed individually in the previoussections., However, there are three important differences. (1) Prior infor- mation From a statistical perspective, there is no prior informa-tion required in addition to a gene expression data set to conductan analysis., In contrast in order to specify a mathematical model, information about the connectivity of the genes is needed andalso the parameter values for the rate and time constants., (2)Purpose: The purpose of both perspectives is different. Whereasthe goal of a statistical approach is to predict interactions betweengenes and gene products and potentially their directionality (notall methods try to do this), the purpose for a mathematical modelis to simulate gene expression levels., (3) Validation From theformer points, there results an immediate consequence for thevalidation of the models., In order to validate predicted interac-tions additional data from different data types are needed thatprovide direct information about biochemical binding activity.For instance, information about the protein-DNA binding fromChIP-chip or ChIP-seq experiments can be used to identify inter- actions between transcription factors and regulated genes., Alsoproteomics data,  e.g.,  from Y2H experiments, provide informa-tion about protein binding and protein complex formation thatcan be used in this respect., In contrast, mathematical modelingapproaches are validated by gene expression data. In Ta b l e 3 ,w e show a summary of these differences. 5. THE THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE MATTERS PRACTICALLY In the following we make an attempt for explaining theunfortunate amalgamation of the statistical perspective and themathematical modeling perspective that might form sources forconfusions and provide also some examples from the literature., First the interdisciplinary character of the problem to infer networks from gene expression data provides such a source byitself., The reason for this is that different subject areas have a dif-ferent educational focus toward either the statistical perspective(computational biologysee Section 2.3), or the mathematicalmodeling perspective (mathematical biologysee Section 3.3).Hence, there is a natural plurality of complementary perspectivesin this field that can get entangled easily., Second some early papers in this field presented in review arti- cles methods from a statistical perspective and the mathematicalmodeling perspective side-by-side, which might have given themisleading impression that there is actually no difference betweenboth ( Dhaeseleer et al., 2000,  Gardner and Faith,  2005 )., These influences can be also observed in more recent review papers fol-lowing the same structure ( Bansal and di Bernardo, 2007,  Hecker et al.,  2009,  Chai et al.,  2014 )., Furthermore, there are research papers that contributed to this impression ( Hoon et al., 2003 ). However we would like to point out that there are also posi-tive examples were this misleading presentation has been avoided, essentially,  by focusing on one perspective only ( de Jong,  2002,  Kim et al.,  2003, Markowetz and Spang,  2007,  Karlebach andShamir,  2008,  Emmert-Streib et al.,  2012 )., In our opinion the very best example to understand the imperative need for a clear distinction of both perspectives isg i v e ni fo n ea s k sf o rt h em e a n i n go fn e t w o r k si n f e r r e df r o mgene expression data., Because the answer is: It depends on yourperspective. The explanation of this, forms our third example. Suppose you assume a mathematical modeling perspective and you use a model that emulates transcription regulation with-out consideration of a protein level., In this case one concludesthat the inferred network corresponds to a transcription regu-lation network., On the other hand if you assume a statisticalperspective using any of the algorithms listed in Ta b l e 1 , t h e meaning of this network is a mixture of a transcription regulationnetwork and a protein interaction network ( Gardner and Faith, 2005,  de Matos Simoes et al.,  2013 ),  as we will see below., The crucial question is how can it happen that we get from the same gene expression data set networks with different (butoverlapping) meaning?, The reason for this is that not the dataalone define the meaning of an inferred network but the com-bination of the data and the method., Specifically the mathe-matical modeling perspective requires us to define a biologicalmodel with a well-defined biological meaning, whereas the sta-tistical perspective does not., Instead all methods in Ta b l e 1 www.frontiersin.org August 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 299 |3 Emmert-Streib et al., Gene regulatory networks FIGURE 1 | Schematic comparison of the statistical perspective (red) and the mathematical modeling perspective (blue)., T able 3 | Comparison of properties features and requirements of statistical and mathematical models that fall under the categorystatistical perspective (Stat P) and mathematical modelingperspective (Math MP)., Stats P Math MP Necessary prior information No Y es Predict interactions Y es No Predict directions Y es No Simulate expression activity No Y es Validation data, ChIP-chip Y es No Validation data,  Y2H Y es No Validation data, gene expression No Y es estimate statistical independence relations (Emmert-Streib et al.,  2012 ), because this is required to estimate causal relations ( Pearl,  2000 )., Unfortunately a statistical independence relation cannot be equated with either transcription regulation or protein-protein interaction, because it is not a model of reality (biology), but a statistical model., So far we established that in the former case a network is a transcriptional regulatory network but are still lacking a mean-ing in the latter case., However this gap can be naturally filledby thinking one step further addressing the question of network validation ., Here by network validation we mean that we com- pare an inferred network with an experimentally determinedbiological network., By using transcriptional regulatory networksand protein interaction networks it has been shown that a net- work inferred from a statistical perspective contains a significantnumber of interactions of both types ( de Matos Simoes et al., 2013 )., Hence such a network is a mixture of a transcriptional regulatory network and a protein interaction network., This isof course not a surprise but has already been discussed before(Gardner and Faith, 2005 ). For reasons of clarity we add a fourth example, discussing a question that we encountered frequently in various arguments.The question is, how can a network whose interactions are acomposition of transcription regulations and protein interactionsprovide a valid model of the biology system?, The answer is sucha network does not aim to be a biological model by itself, butit aims to be a statistical model that allows to make predictionsabout constituting parts of the biological system (see Ta b l e 1 for the purpose of the statistical perspective and the mathematicalmodeling perspective)., 6. SUBJECTIVE OBJECTIVITY We waited until this point in our paper to provide an explanationfor our chosen terminology, i.e.,  why we prefer the term per-spective over,  e.g., formalism to denote the two conceptualcategoriesstatistical perspective and mathematical modelingperspectivebecause based on the arguments presented above, this is easy to understand now., A perspective is commonly asso-ciated with an individual point of view which can be perceived assubjective ., On the other hand, a formalism appears to be objec- tive. In science one strives for objectivity, but every assumption Frontiers in Genetics | Statistical Genetics and Methodology August 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 299 |4 Emmert-Streib et al., Gene regulatory networks one makes is subjective by nature. Hence despite the fact that any statistical formalism and any mathematical modeling formal- ismis fully objective, the selection process itself to pick either one of the formalisms is subjective., From this it appears very natu-ral to chose perspective over formalism to indicate explicitlythat despite of the objectivity of the two formalisms the resultinginterpretation depends on the selection too, as we have seen inour discussion above., 7. A GENOMICS ONTOLOGY FOR INFERRED NETWORKS Due to the expected increase in the next years with respect tomore data, but also novel biotechnologies to generate furtherhigh-throughput data types, we are facing an urgent need toorganize the vocabulary for inferred networks., Specifically dataintegration becomes more and more important implying thatfrom 7 different data types 21 ( =/parenleftbig 7 2/parenrightbig ) different network types can be inferred using two different data types only, whereas inte-grating three data types gives already 35 ( =/parenleftbig 7 3/parenrightbig ) different network types., Considering the fact that the method itself has also an influ-ence on the meaning of such networks it is easy to imagine thatthere are immense problems waiting for us to be addressed inorder to avoid mounting confusion in this area., For this reason we suggest to establish a genomics network ontology that provides a systematic vocabulary for networks inferred from biological, biomedical and clinical omics data., 8. CONCLUSION The purpose of our paper was to generate awareness for theimportant distinction between a statistical perspective and amathematical modeling perspective when inferring networksfrom gene expression data., However this is only one of manyepistemological problems we are currently facing in genomics(Dougherty, 2008 ) generated by the intricate interplay between large-scale high-throughput data and mathematical inferenceprocedures., We hope that such problems receive more appre-ciation in the future because their neglection can lead to dis-astrous effects, especially when entering translational research(Dougherty,  2009 )., ACKNOWLEDGMENT We would like to thank Ricardo de Matos Simoes and Shailesh Tripathi for fruitful discussions., FUNDING Frank Emmert-Streib thanks the Engineering and PhysicalResearch Council (EPSRC EP/H048871/1) for support., MatthiasDehmer thanks the Austrian Science Funds for supporting thiswork (project P26142).

      "answer": "The key findings of the paper \"Untangling statistical and biological models to understand network inference, the need for a genomics network ontology\" by Emmert-Streib et al. are as follows:\n\n1. **Distinction Between Perspectives**: The authors emphasize the importance of distinguishing between two perspectives in network inference from gene expression data: the statistical perspective and the mathematical modeling perspective. Each perspective has different implications for the interpretation of inferred networks.\n\n2. **Statistical Perspective**: This perspective involves using statistical inference methods to draw conclusions about gene interactions without requiring prior biological knowledge. The resulting networks, termed gene regulatory networks (GRNs), provide general predictions about interactions but lack specific biological interpretations.\n\n3. **Mathematical Modeling Perspective**: In contrast, this perspective aims to create realistic models of biological processes, such as transcription and translation. These models require prior biological information and are designed to simulate gene expression dynamics, allowing for meaningful biological interpretations.\n\n4. **Need for a Genomics Network Ontology**: The authors argue for the establishment of a genomics network ontology to provide a systematic vocabulary for networks inferred from various biological data types. This is crucial to avoid confusion arising from the integration of multiple data types and the different meanings that can be derived from the same data set depending on the perspective used.\n\n5. **Interdisciplinary Challenges**: The paper highlights the challenges posed by the interdisciplinary nature of network inference, where different fields may emphasize different perspectives, leading to potential misunderstandings and misinterpretations in the literature.\n\n6. **Implications for Future Research**: The authors stress that as high-throughput technologies evolve, the integration of diverse data types will become increasingly important, making it essential to clarify the theoretical foundations of network inference to ensure accurate biological interpretations.\n\nOverall, the paper advocates for greater conceptual clarity in the field of network inference and underscores the necessity of a structured approach to understanding and communicating the biological implications of inferred networks."

      "question": "How was the data analyzed in the study?",
      "answer": "In the study, the data analysis was approached from two distinct perspectives: the statistical perspective and the mathematical modeling perspective. \n\n1. **Statistical Perspective**: This perspective involves applying statistical inference methods to gene expression data to draw conclusions about biochemical interactions between genes and gene products. The analysis does not require prior biological information and focuses on making predictions regarding the presence and directionality of interactions within gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Various statistical methods are employed to estimate statistical independence relations among random variables, which are then used to construct the GRN component-wise.\n\n2. **Mathematical Modeling Perspective**: In contrast, this perspective aims to create realistic models of biological processes, such as transcription regulation. It requires prior information about gene connectivity and parameter values for the model. The analysis in this perspective focuses on simulating gene expression levels and understanding the dynamical properties of the biological system.\n\nThe authors highlight that the choice of perspective significantly influences the interpretation of the inferred networks.

      "answer": "Yes, the data in the study was pre-processed in a way that is implied through the discussion of the statistical perspective on network inference from gene expression data. The authors mention that statistical inference methods are applied to gene expression data to draw conclusions about biochemical interactions between genes and gene products. This implies that the data would have undergone some form of pre-processing to ensure it is suitable for statistical analysis.\n\nSpecifically, the authors highlight that the inference is based on gene expression data, which provides information about the abundance of mRNAs. This suggests that the data likely underwent normalization and filtering steps to remove noise and irrelevant information, which are common pre-processing techniques in gene expression analysis. However, the paper does not provide explicit details on the specific pre-processing methods used for the data in this study. \n\nOverall, while the paper discusses the implications of using gene expression data for network inference, it does not detail the exact pre-processing steps taken, but it is reasonable to infer that some level of data preparation was necessary to facilitate the statistical analysis."

The authors highlight the distinction between two primary perspectives: the statistical perspective and the mathematical modeling perspective.\n\n1. **Statistical Perspective**: This approach utilizes statistical inference methods to derive conclusions about gene interactions without requiring prior biological knowledge. The authors emphasize that the resulting networks, termed gene regulatory networks, are based solely on statistical relationships derived from gene expression data. They discuss various statistical methods that have been employed in the literature, such as mutual information and regression techniques, and note that these methods aim to predict interactions between genes and gene products.\n\n2. **Mathematical Modeling Perspective**: In contrast, this perspective seeks to create realistic models of biological processes, particularly the transcription of DNA into RNA and subsequent translation into proteins. The authors describe how mathematical models can vary in complexity and detail, and they provide examples of different modeling approaches, including Boolean networks and ordinary differential equations. The goal of this perspective is to simulate biological systems and derive meaningful biological interpretations from the models.\n\n3. **Comparison and Confusion**: The authors point out that the literature often conflates these two perspectives, leading to confusion regarding the biological interpretation of inferred networks.

The authors emphasize the importance of distinguishing between two perspectives: the statistical perspective and the mathematical modeling perspective.\n\n1. **Statistical Perspective**: This approach utilizes statistical inference methods to draw conclusions about gene interactions without requiring prior biological knowledge. The resulting networks, termed gene regulatory networks (GRNs), represent potential interactions among genes based solely on expression data. However, these networks lack specific biological interpretations, as they do not provide insights into the exact nature of the interactions.\n\n2. **Mathematical Modeling Perspective**: In contrast, this perspective aims to create realistic models of biological processes, such as transcription and translation. These models are designed to simulate gene expression dynamics and require prior biological knowledge to define their parameters. The mathematical modeling approach allows for a deeper understanding of the system's behavior and can yield predictions that are biologically meaningful.\n\nThe paper highlights the confusion that arises when these two perspectives are mixed in the literature, leading to misinterpretations of the inferred networks. The authors argue for the establishment of a genomics network ontology to provide a systematic vocabulary for the various types of networks that can be inferred from different data types. This ontology would help clarify the biological meanings of the networks and facilitate better integration of diverse data sets.\n\nIn conclusion, the authors advocate for greater awareness of the distinctions between statistical and mathematical modeling approaches in network inference, as neglecting these differences can lead to significant misunderstandings in the field of genomics. They stress the need for a structured framework to address the challenges posed by the increasing complexity of high-throughput data and the methods used to analyze it."
