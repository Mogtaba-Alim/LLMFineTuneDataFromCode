The NCI-60 screen includes over 55 000 small molecules assayed on 60 core (and 102 additional) cell lines rep- resenting 15 tumor types., PharmacoDB 2.0 includes percentage of treated cell growth (PTC) values down- loaded from the NCI Developmental Therapeutics Pro-gram (https, //wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/NCIDTPdata/NCI- 60+Growth+Inhibition+Data ), for 4 557 787 experiments that included at least four measured doses required forcurve fitting (Supplementary Data)., The PRISM Repur- posing dataset employs a molecular barcoding method to screen drugs against cell lines in pools ( 20, 27)., The bar- coded cell lines from different lineages are assayed for rel- ative mRNA abundance after treatment with a drug or chemicalperturbagentoestimatecellviability.PRISMdrugscreening involves a 2-stage screening strategy, (i) Screen- 1 includes 4518 compounds and 578 cell lines that were assayed in triplicate at a single dose and (ii) Screen-2 in- cludes 1448 drugs that were re-screened against 499 cell lines in triplicate in an 8-point dose response ( 20)., Phar- macoDB2.0includestheScreen-2doseresponsedatawith biologicalreplicate-collapsedlog-foldchangevalues, down- loaded from the Dependency Map Data Portal ( https, // depmap.org/repurposing/ )., After processing these data in- cluded 726 814 experiments with at least 4 dose measure- ments (SupplementaryData)., The GDSC2 dataset was generated using a new screen- ing platform from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institutes Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer project ( 28, 29)., ThedatasetpreviouslyincludedasGDSC1000inPharma- coDB, has been renamed to GDSC1 and updated to in- clude more experiments (323 032 GDSC1 versus 225 480GDSC1000), reflectingtheupdateddataavailablefromthe GDSC project., The GDSC2 dataset represents a different screening approach (using the same cellular viability assayas the Broad and Genentech studies, and an increase in bi- ological replicates) on a similar set of cell lines as GDSC1, with both overlapping and new compounds, and a total of215 780 experiments which were included in PharmacoDB 2.0., More information on the protocol differences between the GDSC1 and GDSC2 data can be found on the GDSCwebsiteat https, //www.cancerrxgene.org/ .Finally, Pharma- coDB 2.0 includes significant updates to Genentechs gCSI dataset.Thenumberofexperimentsavailablehasincreasedfrom6455to16688, primarilythroughtheinclusionofad- ditional35compoundsandextensivebiologicalreplicatein- formation., For all new additions and updates to the database drug annotations were curated by mapping drugs to Pub- Chem (30) identifiers such as compound identifiers (CID), SMILES and InChIKeys using the PUG-REST API ( 31)., Whenever possible, PubChem index names were used asthe standard name in PharmacoDB. Most exceptions oc- curred in the NCI-60 dataset where a large proportion of PubChemindexnamesfollowedIUPACnomenclatureandwere difficult for humans to read., For these we followed the process described in Supplementary Figure S1 to de- cide when to prefer the NCI-60 dataset ID as the stan-dard name for PharmacoDB., Cell lines were annotated us- ingCellosaurus( 25) anonlinecelllineknowledgeresource D1350NucleicAcidsResearch, 2022, Vol.50, Databaseissue Table1., DetailsofnewandupdateddatasetsinPharmacoDB2.0 Dataset Description PSetMolecularData #Celllines #Drugs #Tissues Assay Doseresponsesource ORCESTRA USNationalCancer Institute60anticancer drugscreen( NCI-60)NCI-60datasetconsistsof molecularprofilesas wellas the doseresponsedatafromscreening smallmoleculesincluding approvedandinvestigationaldrug compoundsRNA-seq isoforms RNA-seq composite Microar- ray MicroRNA162 54774 15 SulforhodamineBcolorimetry https, //wiki.nci.nih.gov/ download/attachments/ 147193864/DOSERESP.zip?, version=1&modificationDate= 1622830743000&api=v2https //orcestra.ca/pset/10.5281/ zenodo.5570629 ThePRISM Repurposingdataset ( PRISM)ThePRISMdatasetconsistsof doseresponsedatafromassessingthe anti-cancereffects of non-oncologydrugson human cancercell-linesusingthePRISM barcodingmethoddevelopedby BroadInstituteofMITand Harvard*RNA-seq Microar- ray Mutation CNV**480 1437 22 PRISM(Luminex) https, //ndownloader.figshare., com/files/20237757https //orcestra.ca/pset/10.5281/ zenodo.5570757 GenomicsofDrug SensitivityinCancer (GDSC1)GenomicsofDrugSensitivityin Cancer(GDSC)Projectis partofa collaborationbetweenWellcomeTrustSangerInstituteandthe MassachusettsGeneralHospital CancerCenter.Both GDSC1and 2 datasetscontainsdoseresponseas wellas moleculardatafrom screeninganti-cancertherapeutics acrossgeneticallycharacterizedhumancancercelllinesRNA-seq Microar- ray Mutation Muta- tion(Exome) CNV Fusion1104 303 29 ResazurinorSyto60 ftp, //ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/project/ cancerrxgene/releases/release-8.2/GDSC1 publicrawdata25Feb20., csvhttps //orcestra.ca/pset/10.5281/ zenodo.3905485 GenomicsofDrug SensitivityinCancer (GDSC2)RNA-seq Microar- ray Mutation Muta- tion (Exome) CNV Fusion1104 190 29 CellTiterGlo ftp, //ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/project/ cancerrxgene/releases/release-8.2/ GDSC2 publicrawdata25Feb20., csvhttps //orcestra.ca/pset/10.5281/ zenodo.3905481 TheGenentechCell LineScreening Initiative( gCSI)ThegCSIdataweregeneratedand sharedbyGenentechas partofthe GenentechCellLineScreening Initiative.gCSIdatasetincludes doseresponsedataas wellas and molecularprofilesfrom screening drugsonindependently characterizedcelllinesRNA- s e qM u t a t i o nC N V788 44 27 CellTiterGlo http, //research-pub.gene.com/ gCSIGRvalues2019/ gCSIGRdata v1.3.tsv.tar.gzhttps, //orcestra.ca/pset/10.5281/ zenodo.4737437 An overview of the new and updated datasets, types of molecular profiles included in each dataset,  number of cell lines,  drugs, and tissue types in each d ataset,  and the assay type used for measuring the doseresponse values., The link to both the source of raw doseresponsedataandthecorrespondingPSets onORCESTRAis providedinthetable.Note, ThenumberofdrugsisreportedbasedonthePSetsuniquedrugIDs(SupplementaryData)., *Celllines aredirectlyobtainedfrom theCellBroad-NovartisCancerCellLineEncyclopedia(CCLE)project.Molecularprofilesare accessiblefrom CCLEdataseton ORCESTRA( https, //orcestra.ca/pset/10.5281/zenodo.3905462 )., **19outof499 originalcelllinesfailed theSTRfingerprintingcomparisontestsand werenotincludedin thePSet., NucleicAcidsResearch,2022,Vol.50,Databaseissue D1351 Figure 1.

PharmacoDB 2.0 is ma de fully reproducible through the use of the ORCESTRA platform and automated data ingestion pipelines., ( B) Bar plots showing previous (Version 1) and current(Version2)databasestatistics. that documents cell lines used in biomedical research. On- coTree (32) was used to re-label the tissues of cancer cell lines profiled intoan externallydefined ontology., IMPLEMENTATION OF REPRODUCIBLE PIPELINES With large amounts of pharmacogenomic data released frommultiplestudies, thereproducibilityofcomputational pipelines used to process these multimodal data is essen-tial., This includes adhering to the FAIR data principles along with ensuring that there is a standardized manner in which the pipelines are executed and the data is hosted., Toaddress this important issue we used ORCESTRA ( https,  //orcestra.ca/ ), aplatformthatallowsresearcherstoprocess biomedical data into unified data objects in a reproducibleand transparent manner, where data provenance is tracked (33)., At the heart of ORCESTRA is Pachyderm ( https //www.pachyderm.com/ ), an open-source data versioning toolusedtoexecutepipelinesprocessingthemolecularand compound screening data, and packaging the datasets into R objects called PharmacoSets (PSets), which are imple-mented by the PharmacoGx package ( 34)., At the end of each PSet processing pipeline the created object is auto- matically deposited on Zenodo and assigned a digital ob- D1352NucleicAcidsResearch, 2022, Vol.50, Databaseissue ject identifier (DOI)., Once the highly curated and stan- dardized PSets are released via ORCESTRA they need to be preprocessed into tables which match the PharmacoDB Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) before being loadedinto the database., To ensure that the data ingestion stan- dards in PharmacoDB adhere to FAIR data principles the Pharmaco-DataIngestion(PharmacoDI)projectwasiniti-ated to create an Extract Transform Load (ETL) pipeline which adheres to modern data engineering best practices (35, 36)., ThePharmacoDIprojectconsistsofthreemajorcompo- nents. First the rPharmacoDI ( https, //github.com/bhklab/ rPharmacoDI ) R package provides an interface to down- load and export PSets in a Python compatible for- mat., Second the PharmacoDI ( https, //pypi.org/project/ PharmacoDI ) Python package contains a set of func- tions for transforming the exported raw PSet data into ta- bles which match the PharmacoDB schema, leveraging the Python Datatable package to allow larger than memory data processing., Finally the Snakemake workflow man- agement tool is used to integrate ORCESTRA,  rPharma-coDI, PharmacoDI and PharmacoDB into a fully modu- lar and scalable ETL pipeline ( https, //github.com/bhklab/ PharmacoDI snakemake pipeline) which ensures that all softwaredependencies, metadataandcodeareversioncon- trolled, transparentandfullyreproducible.Thispipelinein- cludes a number of additional features which keeps Phar-macoDB annotations up to date, such as dynamic queries to ChEMBL ( 26) and Cellosaurus ( 25) to fetch respec- tive drug and cell line metadata., Automated quality con-trolchecksareimplementedthroughoutthepipelinetoen- sure data integrity and flag data for manual review if prob- lems are detected., Once quality control passes the PythonSQLAlchemy package is used to connect with our Azure MySQL database where database tables are automatically created and loaded before being deployed for use in thePharmacoDB web-application (Figure 2)., CONNECTIVITY TO EXTERNAL DATABASES While the original PharmacoDB database included links to external databases for drugs, genes and cell lines, Phar- macoDB 2.0 focuses on creating bidirectional links to im- prove discoverability of the available pharmacogenomicdata., Unique stable identifiers were created for both drugs andcelllinesinthePharmacoDBdatabase allowingexter- nal databases to link directly to entities in PharmacoDB.A collection of drugs from PharmacoDB 2.0 are bidirec- tionallylinkedtoReactome( 23), anonlinedatabaseofbio- logicalpathwaysincludingdrugmechanismsofaction.Re-actome provides detailed insights into drug targets, bind- ingpartnersandsubsequentbiologicalpathwaysassociated with target action., PharmacoDB drugs are also linked toDrug Target Commons (DTC) ( 24) a community-driven web platform for compound-target bioactivity assay anno- tation profiles relevant for drug discovery and repurpos-ing., ChEMBL ( 26) IDs matching our compound identi- fiersareaddedinadditiontoPubChemidentifiers.Thecell lines from the datasets are bidirectionally linked and an- notated to Cellosaurus ( 25), which is a cell line informa- tionresource.Additionalcelllinemetadatasuchasdisease, metastasissite, speciesandlinkstoexternaldatabasessuch as DepMap are available from Cellosaurus for the linked cell lines., The external links can be found in the individ- ual drug and cell line pages of PharmacoDB as well as inexternal web-applications., In addition PharmacoDB APIs areimplementedusingJavaScriptprogramminglanguagein ExpresswhichisabackendwebapplicationframeworkforNodeJS.GraphQL( https, //graphql.org/ ), whichisanopen- sourcedataqueryandmanipulationlanguage

tofacilitateuseroperability.TheAPIscanbeaccessedwith-outany authenticationprocess or tokens., ENHANCED DATA ANALYSIS Tissue-specific analysis Building on top of the newly standardized tissue ontology, PharmacoDB 2.0 has been updated with a focus on tissue- specific analysis throughout the web application., Pharma- coDB 2.0 contains cell response data for a large panel of1757 cell lines spanning across 30 tissues., Moreover Phar- macoDB includes data for a large portfolio of 589 FDA approved drugs, several investigational drugs,  tool or leadcompounds,  and natural substances, all with varying levels of activity across and within tissue types., Therefore the vi- sualizationswithintheweb-applicationhavebeenextendedtohelpidentifypatternsofsensitivityacrossandwithintis- sue(s)., On each individual drug page the differential sensi- tivity to a compound across tissues is displayed as a box- plot, givingaquickoverviewofthetissuesthataresensitive orresistanttoacompound.Aswithalltheplotsintheweb-application, thiscanbedisplayedbyintegratingdataacross all datasets or filtered by dataset(s)., For example viewing thisplotacrossalldatasetsforDabrafenibclearlyindicatesthe well known preferential sensitivity of BRAF mutated skin cancers to BRAF inhibition ( 37), and its absence in other tissues (even tissues known to harbour mutations inthe BRAF pathway, such as bowel) (Figure 3A)., Alterna- tively within PharmacoDB 2.0 it is possible to investigate the differential sensitivity to a compound within a tissuetypebycomparingthedrugdoseresponsecurvesacrossall celllinestestedinalldatasetsforaparticulartissue.Contin- uing with the example of Dabrafenib, it is possible to iden-tify the most sensitive and resistant skin cell lines, using ei- ther the sensitivity summary metrics provided in Pharma- coDB(suchastheareaabovethecurve [AAC]orthedrugconcentration necessary to inhibit 50% of the maximal cell

copy number variation computed using the PharmacoGx package ( 34)., The data were presented in a plain table for- mat useful only for ranking associations by significance or effectsize.PharmacoDB2.0extendsthisbyprovidinginter-pretable visualizations to compare and contextualize these associations, extends the analysis to tissue-specific associa- tions and incorporates updates to the statistical methodol-ogytoevaluatethestrengthandsignificanceofthesemark- ers., The previous pipeline used to evaluate the associations between all feature types and drug response was based around a linear modelling approach, and relied on ana- lyticalP-values derived from assumptions of normality., However both the distributions of molecular features and drugresponse metrics can deviate significantly from nor- mal, potentially inducing biases in the estimation of theseP-values(38).Thisisexacerbatedbyouradditionoftissue- specificassociationstothedatabase, forwhichsamplesizes are much smaller (dozens versus hundreds of cell lines).Therefore, PharmacoDB 2.0 includes both analytic and permutation-estimated P-values for associations, increas- ing the reliability of statistical significance estimates in thedatabase(detailsonstatisticalmethodologyareavailablein theSupplementaryData)., Tissue-specificgene-compoundassociationsrequireeval- uating thecorrelation

increasingthetableassociationsfrom approximately33.5millionpan-cancerassociationstoover400 million tissue specific associations (after filtering out associations based on <20 cell lines)., While analytical test results are available for all associations permutation test-ing of all 400 million associations is a lengthy and ongo- ingprocess.Currently, PharmacoDBcontainstheresultsof

gene-compound association (tissue-specific or pan-cancer) is now associated with a biomarker page within the web application, which contains summary in-formation about the gene,  the compound, and two types of plots contextualizing the associations available for this gene and compound pair in the database., A forest plot al-lowsuserstocomparethestrengthofassociationsbetween the compound and gene across datasets., In Figure 3C we show the association between the validated biomarker ofERBB2expression( 39, 40)andLapatinibresponseinbreast tissue., The forest plot gives a visual summary of the repro- ducibility of this marker across studies. As a forest plot isdisplayed for each available molecular feature type it also facilitates comparison of the drugresponse effect between expression,  copy number, and mutation alterations of thesame gene., The second plot specifically designed for copy D1354NucleicAcidsResearch, 2022, Vol.50, Databaseissue Figure 3., Visualization of tissue-specific drugresponse and genedrug associations.

It can be used either for check- ingifan experimenthasbeencarried outbyotherresearch groups or to compare experiment outcomes with publicdata., Information on the cell line and tissue breakdown of drug studies in datasets sensitivity across tissues and top genedrug associations are particularly helpful in this re- gard., PharmacoDB also helps users check the association oftheirgeneofinterestwithdrugresponse andfurtheran-alyze thereliabilityofapotentialbiomarker across various studies., Finally PharmacoDB serves as a tool for drug re- purposingbyprovidingdrugresponseontissuetypesotherthan thedrugs approved indication., Since the first publication of PharmacoDB in 2018 sev- eral other web applications have arisen which integratepharmacogenomicsstudies, includingCellMinerCDB( 41),  andtheDependencyMapPortalintegratingGDSC, CTRP and PRISM drug response data with RNAi and CRISPRessentialityscreeningdata( 3, 4, 20, 27).Thesethreewebtools have converged on a core set of functionality, allowing the exploration of doseresponse data, comparisons be-tween datasets and exploration of molecular features asso- ciated with drug response., However, each tool fills a dif- ferent niche. DepMap is focused on providing interactiveaccess to the Dependency Map project data integrating molecular profiling,  compound screening and essentiality datasets.Assuch, researcherswhoareinterestedincompar-ing data modalities generated by this project would benefit fromaccesstoalldifferentdatamodalitiesthroughonepor- tal., CellMinerCDB is focused on integrating NCI deriveddatawiththelargerpublicdatasetsfromtheBroad Sanger andMDAndersoninstitutesanduniquelyprovidesinterac- tivetoolsformultivariatemodellingofcompoundresponsefrom molecular features., PharmacoDB in contrast to the other websites, has focused on integrating across a wider range of pharmacogenomics studies, and includes majorpan-cancer screening initiatives as well as smaller,  tissue- specific studies., Researchers interested in a large collec- tionofindependentdatasetsforintegrativeormeta-analysis would benefit from the larger number of studies covered byPharmacoDB.Thiscanbeespeciallyusefulformachinelearningresearchers, whereitisimportanttohaveindepen- denttrainingandmultipletestingdatasetstoshowgeneral- izability.However, PharmacoDBdoesnotatthistimeinte- grateanygeneessentialitydata, andresearcherslookingforsuch datawill be betterserved bythe othertwo tools., FutureworkonPharmacoDBwillbefocusedonbuilding upon its strengths.

If previous research relied on older versions of these datasets or different methodologies for data integration, there could be discrepancies in findings. However, the paper does not explicitly state contradictions with prior findings.\n\n2. **Statistical Methodology**: The paper highlights improvements in statistical methodologies, including the use of both analytic and permutation-estimated P-values for evaluating associations between molecular features and drug response. If previous studies used different statistical approaches that led to different conclusions, this could indicate a potential contradiction. However, the paper does not provide specific examples of such contradictions.\n\n3. **Tissue-Specific Analysis**: The paper emphasizes the importance of tissue-specific analysis and presents new visualizations for drug response across various tissues. If earlier studies did not account for tissue specificity or reported different patterns of drug response, this could lead to conflicting interpretations. Again, the paper does not provide direct evidence of contradictions.\n\n4. **Comparative Analysis with Other Databases**: The paper mentions that other databases like CellMinerCDB and DepMap have emerged, which integrate pharmacogenomics studies. If these databases report different findings regarding drug responses or molecular associations, it could suggest contradictions. However, the paper does not elaborate on specific conflicting results from these databases.\n\nIn conclusion, while the paper presents significant advancements and improvements in pharmacogenomics analysis, it does not explicitly identify any contradictions with previous research findings. The focus is more on enhancing the database's capabilities and integrating new data rather than directly challenging or contradicting past studies. Further comparative studies would be necessary to identify any specific contradictions in findings."
