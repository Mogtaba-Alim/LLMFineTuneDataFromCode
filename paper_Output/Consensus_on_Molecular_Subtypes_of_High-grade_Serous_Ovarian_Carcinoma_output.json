Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript on concordantly classified samples to yield a consensus classification of patient tumors that correlates with patient age, survival,  tumor purity,  and lymphocyte infiltration., Conclusion A new consensus ovarian subtype classifier represents the consensus of methods, and demonstrates the importance of classification approaches for cancer that do not require all tumors to be assigned to a distinct subtype., Introduction Ovarian carcinoma is a genomically complex disease for which the accurate characterization of molecular subtypes is difficult but is anticipated to improve treatment and clinical outcome( 1)., Substantial effort has been devoted to characterize molecularly distinct subtypes of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) (Table 1)., Initial large-scale efforts to classify HGSOC of the ovary did not reveal any reproducible subtypes( 2)., Tothill et al( 3) reported four distinct HGSOC subtypes ( i) an immunoreactive expression subtype associated with infiltration of immune cells, ( ii) a low stromal expression subtype with high levels of circulating CA125, ( iii) a poor prognosis subtype displaying strong stromal response, correlating with extensive desmoplasia, and ( iv) a mesenchymal subtype with high expression of N/P-cadherins., The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project also identified four subtypes characterized by ( i) chemokine expression in the immunoreactive subtype, ( ii) proliferation marker expression in the proliferative subtype, ( iii) ovarian tumor marker expression in the differentiated subtype, and ( iv) expression of markers suggestive of increased stromal components in the mesenchymal subtype, but did not report differences in patient survival( 4)., Further experimental characterization revealed an increased number of samples with infiltrating T lymphocytes for the immunoreactive subtype, whereas desmoplasia,  associated with infiltrating stromal cells, was found more often for the mesenchymal subtype( 5)., Konecny et al. (6) independently evaluated the TCGA subtypes and also reported the presence of the four transcriptional subtypes using a de novo clustering and classification method., However, robustness and clinical relevance of these subtypes remain controversial( 7). The previous subtyping efforts have assessed prognostic significance in different patient cohorts and have taken different approaches to validate these subtypes in independent datasets., A recent review of HGSOC subtyping schemes highlighted the difficulty of comparing results of studies that used different subtyping algorithms, and that better general agreement on how molecular subtypes are defined would allow more widespread use of expression data in clinical trial design., ( 1) Assessing the generalizability of subtyping algorithms is challenging as true subtype classifications remain unknown., This challenge is evident in the lack of published validation of the proposed HGSOC subtypes. Subsequent efforts have performed de novo clustering of new datasets and noted similarity in the clusters identified, but they have not reported quantitative measures such as classification accuracy or rate of concordance with previously published algorithms( 8)., In this article we address these limitations by re-implementing three major subtyping methods( 3, 5, 9) and assess between-classifier concordance and across- dataset robustness in a widely used database containing 1, 770 HGSOC tumors( 10),  whose Chen et al., Page 2 Clin Cancer Res . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 October 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript curation and data consistency has been independently validated( 11)., We show that each pair of subtype classifiers are significantly concordant and are virtually identical for tumors classified with high certainty., However the subtypes do not meet established standards of robustness to re-clustering( 12) and only approximately one-third of tumors are classified concordantly by all three subtype classifiers., Using this core set of tumors concordantly classified by each method we develop consensusOV , a consensus classifier that has high concordance with the three classifiers, therefore providing a standardized classification scheme for clinical applications., Materials and Methods Datasets Analysis was carried out on datasets from the curatedOvarianData compendium, details of curation and of grading systems used by individual studies are described elsewhere ( 10)., Datasets were additionally processed using the MetaGxOvarian package( 13) (Supplementary Information)., Analysis was restricted to datasets featuring microarray-based whole-transcriptome studies of at least 40 patients with late stage, high-grade,  primary tumors of serous histology., This resulted in 15 microarray studies, providing data for 1,774 patients (Table 2). Duplicated samples identified by the doppelgangR package were removed( 14). Survival analysis was performed for 13 of these datasets which included 1, 581 patients with annotated time to death or last time of follow-up., Implementation of Subtype Classifiers Subtype classifiers were re-implemented in R( 15) using original data as described by Konecny( 6), Verhaak( 5),  and Helland( 9)., These classifiers are based on nearest-centroids( 6) subtype-specific single-sample GSEA( 5), and subtype-specific linear coefficients( 9),  respectively., Implementations were validated by reproducing a result from each of the original publications (Supplemental File, Section Reproduction of Published HGSOC Subtype Classifiers)., Survival Analysis Subtype calls from all included datasets were combined to generate a single Kaplan-Meier plot for each subtyping algorithm (stratified by subtype)., Hazard ratios for overall survival between subtypes was estimated by Cox proportional hazards and statistical significance was assessed by log-rank test using the survcomp R package( 16)., Hazard ratios were calculated using the lowest-risk subtype as the baseline group and stratification by dataset was performed for hazard ratios and significance testing., Prediction Strength Prediction Strength( 12) is defined as a measure of the similarity between pairwise co- memberships of a validation dataset from class labels assigned by ( 1) a clustering algorithm and ( 2) a classification algorithm trained on a training dataset (Supplementary Figure 1)., The quantity is an established measure of cluster robustness with the following interpretation a value of 0 or below indicates poor concordance, and a value of 1 indicates perfect concordance between models specified from training and validation data., Tibshirani and Chen et al. Page 3 Clin Cancer Res . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 October 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Walther( 12) and subsequent applications of Prediction Strength( 17), have considered a value of at least 0.8 to be an evidence of robust clusters., Prediction Strength was computed as implemented in the genefu Bioconductor package( 18). The tumors in each dataset were clustered de novo using our reproduced implementations of the algorithms of Konecny, TCGA/Verhaak,  and Tothill (Supplemental File, Section Reproduction of Subtype Clustering Methods)., Each dataset was also classified using implementation of the originally published subtype classifiers., This produced two sets of subtype labels for each sample in each validation dataset these labels were used to compute Prediction Strength., Concordance Analysis For each pair of classifiers subtypes were mapped based on the observed concordance suggested in the original studies, Subtype C2 from Tothill corresponding to Immunoreactive in TCGA/Verhaak and C1_Immunoreactive-like in Konecny, C4 corresponding to Differentiated and C2_Differentiated-like, C5 corresponding to Proliferative and C3_Proliferative-like, and C1 corresponding to Mesenchymal and C4_Mesenchymal-like., Statistical significance of pairwise concordance was assessed by Pearsons Chi-squared test and Cramers V was assessed to evaluate the strength of concordance., Two-way concordance was defined as the proportion of patients that were classified as the same mapped subtype across methods., Similarly overall three-way concordance was defined as the proportion of tumors sharing the same mapped subtype across all three classifiers., Subtype-specific three-way concordance was defined as the number of tumors concordantly classified as that subtype by all three classifiers, divided by the number of tumors classified to that subtype by at least one method., Filtering tumors by classification margin Each subtype classifier outputs for each patient a real-valued score for each subtype., Marginally classifiable tumors were identified based on the difference between the top two subtype scores, denoted as the margin value., Thus, a higher margin indicates a more confident classification. For each pair of subtype classifiers classification concordance was assessed on both the full dataset and considering only patients classified with margins above a user-defined cutoff., Building a consensus classifier The consensusOV classifier was implemented using a Random Forest classifier trained on concordantly-subtyped tumors across multiple datasets., The Random Forest method has previously been used for building a multi-class consensus classifier to resolve inconsistencies among published colorectal cancer subtyping schemes( 19)., In order to avoid normalizing expression values across datasets binary gene pair vectors were used as feature space, as recently applied for breast cancer subtyping( 20, 21)., To address differences in gene expression scales due to different experimental protocols consensusOV first standardizes genes in each dataset to the same mean and variance, and computes binary gene pairs from standardized expression values., Since the feature size of this classifier increases quadratically with respect to the size of the original gene set, we used the smallest gene set Chen et al., Page 4 Clin Cancer Res . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 October 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript of the original subtype classifiers (the gene set of Verhaak et al., (5)), which contains 100 gene symbols. The consensusOV classifier outputs the subtype classification and a real- valued margin score to discriminate between patients that are of well-defined or indeterminate subtype., Similarly to previously published subtype classifiers a higher margin score indicates higher confidence of classification., Leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation Performance of the consensus classifier for identifying concordantly classified subtypes was assessed using leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation( 22)., Concordant subtypes were identified to train the Random Forest classifier using 14 of the 15 datasets, and subtype predictions were tested in the remaining left-out dataset., This process was repeated for all 15 datasets. While predicting the samples in any given dataset the training set was subsetted to contain only the concordant subtypes in other datasets., Correlation analysis with Histopathology and Tumor Purity Subtype calls from the Consensus Classifier were analysed for correlation with histopathology and tumor purity in the TCGA dataset., In order to best represent the most confident subtype calls a default cutoff was used to include only the 25% of patients with the largest classification margins., Available histopathology variables included lymphocyte, monocyte, and neutrophil infiltration. Tumor purity was assessed using the ABSOLUTE algorithm( 23) which estimates purity and ploidy from copy number and SNP allele frequency from SNP genotyping arrays (Synapse dataset syn3242754)., Significance of associations were tested by one-way ANOV A for patient age purity, and immune infiltration., Research reproducibility All results are reproducible using R/Bioconductor( 24) and knitr( 25) with LaTeX output at overleaf.com/read/srvqbpxpqbyz ., Output of this code is provided as Supplemental File 1. Subtyping algorithms are provided by the open source consensusOV R package available from Bioconductor ( http, //bioconductor.org/packages/consensusOV )., Results We performed a meta-analysis of three published subtyping algorithms for HGSOC( 56, 9) and developed a new consensus classifier to identify unambiguously classifiable tumors (Table 1)., Each of these algorithms identified four distinct HGSOC subtypes with specific clinical and tumor pathology characteristics (Figure 1)., We assessed the algorithms on a compendium of 15 datasets including over 1 700 HGSOC patients (Table 2) with respect to concordance,  robustness, and association to patient outcome., By modifying individual algorithms to discard tumors of intermediate subtype we found that concordance between algorithms is greatly improved., Concordance of published classifiers We reimplemented three published HGSOC subtype classifiers( 56, 9) (Table 1) and applied these methods to new datasets., We ensured correct implementation of classifiers by Chen et al. Page 5 Clin Cancer Res . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 October 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript reproducing results from the original papers (Supplementary Information)., When applied to independent datasets pairwise concordance of the three methods was statistically significant (p < 105,  Chi-square test, Figure 2A) with the highest agreement observed for Helland and Konecny subtyping schemes (70.9%), followed by Verhaak and Helland (67.4%) and Verhaak and Konecny (58.9%)., Cramers V coefficients( 26) indicated a strong association between subtypes as identified by the different algorithms (>0.5)., Tumors of intermediate subtype The individual subtyping algorithms calculate numeric scores for each subtype, and assign each tumor to the subtype with the highest score., A tumor with a large difference or margin between the highest and second highest scores can be considered distinctly classifiable, whereas a tumor with two nearly equal scores could be considered of intermediate subtype., We examined the effect of modifying the individual algorithms to prevent assignment of indeterminate cases at various thresholds., For each pair of subtype classifiers we examined the classification concordance with increasing thresholds on the margins., For all pairs of subtype classifier classification concordance increased as additional marginal cases are removed, approaching over 90% concordance once the majority of tumors are left unclassified (Figure 2B)., Three-way concordance followed the same trend with lower overall concordance a minimum of 23% for the proliferative subtype and maximum of 45% for the immunoreactive subtype when all tumors are classified., Restricting the concordance analysis to the top 50% of tumors by margin value resulted in an increased overlap between 35% (proliferative) and 65% (immunoreactive)., At a strict threshold of where only 10% of tumors are classified 88% of tumors overall are concordantly classified by all three published subtyping algorithms (Figure 2C)., This large gain in concordance results from large reductions in both singleton calls - tumors assigned to one subtype by one algorithm, but not by the other two algorithms - and in 2-to-1 calls, tumors assigned to one subtype by two algorithms,  but not by the third (Figure 2D)., This indicates that tumors distinctly classifiable by a single algorithm are more likely to be concordantly classified by the other algorithms, and conversely, tumors that appear ambiguous to one algorithm are less likely to be classified in the same way by the other algorithms., Survival Analysis All proposed subtyping algorithms classified patients into groups that significantly differed in overall survival (Figure 3A, p < 105 for each subtyping algorithm,  log-rank test)., Comparing low-risk to high-risk subtypes for each algorithm the hazard ratios increase from approximately 1.5 as marginal cases are removed (Figure 3B), suggesting that marginal cases may contribute to the intermediate survival profiles between subtypes., Robustness of the Classifiers Robust molecular subtyping should be replicable in multiple datasets. We performed de novo clustering in 15 independent ovarian datasets using the authors original gene lists and clustering methods., We compared these de novo clusters to the labels from our Chen et al. Page 6 Clin Cancer Res . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 October 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript implementation of the published classifiers to assess robustness using the Prediction Strength (PS) statistic( 12)., For PS estimation, we included validation datasets with at least 100 HGSOC tumors. Overall we observed low robustness for all classifiers with PS values under 0.6 for the three algorithms across datasets (Supplementary Figure 2), none meeting the 0.8 threshold typically indicating robust classes( 12, 17)., To assess whether low confidence predictions are driving the PS estimation we re-computed the robustness of each algorithm set to classify varying fractions of the tumors with the highest margins., We used the largest dataset available the TCGA dataset,  as the validation set, and varied margin cutoffs of the Tothill and Konecny classifiers to require them to classify between 25% and 100% of the cases., From 10 random clustering runs, we report the median PS for the dataset. Clustering was performed on the full TCGA dataset and tumors of low margin values were removed subsequent to clustering and after the classifier was fully defined, in order to avoid optimistically biasing the apparent strength of clusters., We observed that the robustness of each algorithm is substantially improved by preventing them tto classify ambiguous cases., The Tothill algorithm achieved almost perfect robustness (PS = 0.96) when allowed to leave 75% of cases unclassified (Figure 4)., Consensus Classifier To maximize concordance across classifiers we developed consensusOV , a consensus subtyping scheme facilitating classification of tumors of well-defined subtypes (Figure 5)., This classifier uses binary gene pairs( 20 21) to support application across gene expression platforms., The consensusOV classifier exhibits overall pairwise concordance of 67  78% with each of the other three algorithms, when classifying all tumors, and 94% concordance with tumors that are concordantly classified by the other three algorithms (Figure 5A)., The margins of consensusOV are higher for concordantly classified cases than for non- concordantly classified cases, and this difference in margins is greater than for any of the other three classifiers (Figure 6A)., Accordingly consensusOV was also most effective in identifying concordantly classified cases, although it was similar to the Konecny classifier in this respect (AUC = 0.76,  Figure 6B)., As expected differences in survival of subsets identified by consensusOV are similar to those identified by previous classifiers., The highest risk subtypes are proliferative (HR=1.44 95% CI,  1.071.94) and mesenchymal (HR=1.97, 95% CI,  1.462.67) when removing 75% of indeterminate low-margin tumors, with similar hazard ratios for the concordant cases (Figure 5B)., Discussion The existence of four distinct and concordant molecular subtypes of HGSOC has been reported in several studies of large patient cohorts( 46, 9),  but also called into question by another effort( 2) that could not identify subtypes, and by an independent validation effort that reported only two or three reproducible subtypes( 27)., Meanwhile significant effort is being expended to translate these subtypes to clinical practice, for example to predict response to the angiogenesis inhibitor bevacizumab in the ICON7 trial( 28, 29)., Our study pursues three major objectives ( 1) reproduction of published subtype classification algorithms as an open-source resource, ( 2) evaluation of the robustness and prognostic value Chen et al., Page 7 Clin Cancer Res . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 October 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript of each proposed subtyping scheme in independent data, and ( 3) consolidation of proposed subtyping schemes into a consensus algorithm., We find that while the proposed 4-subtype classifications demonstrate significant concordance and association with patient survival, none are robust to re-training in new datasets., By modifying any of these algorithms to prevent classification of tumors of ambiguous subtype robustness and concordance of subtyping algorithms improve dramatically., We propose a consensus classifier that can identify the most unambiguously classifiable tumors although a continuous trade-off exists between classifying more tumors versus having greater confidence in those classified., Ambiguity in tumor classification might arise from a heterogeneous admixture of different subtypes or from a more homogeneous composition of indeterminate subtype., This distinction has implications for the therapeutic value of the proposed subtypes. Lohr et al. estimated that 90% of tumors in the TCGA HGSOC dataset are polyclonal( 30) and clonal spread of HGSOC has been directly inferred from single-nucleus sequencing( 31)., However it remains unclear whether multiple clones in a tumor are consistently classifiable to the same subtype., If a tumor consists of multiple clones of different subtypes then a subtype- specific therapy will likely lead to relapse as other clones survive and continue to grow., If this situation is common even unambiguously classifiable tumors might be contaminated by small amounts of another subtype that could lead to relapse after subtype-specific therapy., This question could not be resolved by the current datasets but may eventually be addressed by single-cell RNA sequencing( 32) which is expected to further improve precision HGSOC molecular subtyping., Several findings stand out in the validation of published subtyping algorithms. First although previous studies reported inconsistent findings on whether subtypes differ by patient survival, our analysis in independent data showed clear survival differences., The 5- year survival rate for patients with different subtypes ranged from as low as 20% to as high as 50%., Second published algorithms do not meet previously defined standards of robustness in terms of Prediction Strength, a measure of consistency between subtype classifiers trained in independent datasets., Finally the concordance of three algorithms, established independently by different research groups from different patient cohorts, is only moderate but can be greatly improved by modifying the original algorithms to allow them to leave ambiguous tumors unclassified., In their original forms all-way concordance of the four defined classes occurs in 23% to 45% of tumors., As the individual algorithms are modified so they are allowed to leave ambiguous cases unclassified the minority of remaining tumors can be classified with over 90% concordance between the three algorithms., This is a novel finding of interest because an alternate possibility was that classifiers trained on different datasets would suffer low concordance no matter how they treated uncertain tumors., This finding suggests a subset of tumors of pure subtype unfortunately, such unambiguous cases account for as few as 25% of HGSOC tumors., This places important limitations on the potential for clinical application of HGSOC subtypes. The proposed alternative consensusOV , identifies the consensus of published HGSOC subtype classifiers., By training on multiple datasets using binary (pairwise greater-than or less-than) relationships between pairs of genes, and using a relatively small gene set,  it is Chen et al., Page 8 Clin Cancer Res . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 October 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript designed to identify robustly classifiable HGSOC tumors across gene expression platforms and datasets., Moving forward general agreement on how molecular subgroups of ovarian cancer are defined would facilitate the use of expression data in clinical management., ( 33). The present subgroups while prognostically important are not yet clinically meaningful. Much like other prognostic factors such as age ascites,  and histology, they do not alter clinical management., However a better understanding of the biology underlying the subgroups will provide a more rational targeted treatment of those patients (perhaps first in trial) such as seen in HRD tumors with PARP inhibitors., The use of algorithms that can classify the tumor of an individual patient while allowing some tumors to remain unclassified, along with assessment of subtype robustness in independent datasets by Prediction Strength, would move the field closer to this goal., Supplementary Material Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.

Various computational methods for gene expression-based subtyping have been proposed, but their overlap and robustness are unclear. The authors assess three major subtype classifiers through meta-analysis of publicly available expression data, evaluating their robustness and concordance. They develop a consensus classifier that reflects the subtype classifications based on multiple methods and provides a confidence score. The results indicate moderate concordance among HGSOC subtyping classifiers and highlight that current subtypes do not meet statistical robustness criteria. The new consensus classifier correlates with patient age, survival, tumor purity, and lymphocyte infiltration. The study concludes that this consensus classifier is significant for cancer classification, allowing for some tumors to remain unclassified, which is crucial for improving treatment strategies."

Here\u2019s a detailed description of the methodology:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: The study utilized a compendium of publicly available gene expression datasets from the curatedOvarianData compendium, focusing on microarray-based whole-transcriptome studies of late-stage, high-grade, primary tumors of serous histology. A total of 15 microarray studies were included, providing data for 1,774 patients. Duplicated samples were removed to ensure data integrity.\n\n2. **Implementation of Subtype Classifiers**: The authors re-implemented three major subtype classifiers based on previous studies (Konecny, Verhaak, and Helland). These classifiers utilized different algorithms, including nearest-centroids, single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and subtype-specific linear coefficients. The implementations were validated by reproducing results from the original publications.\n\n3. **Survival Analysis**: The subtype classifications from all datasets were combined to generate Kaplan-Meier survival plots for each subtyping algorithm. Hazard ratios for overall survival were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models, and statistical significance was assessed via log-rank tests.\n\n4. **Prediction Strength Assessment**: The robustness of the classifiers was evaluated using Prediction Strength, a measure of the similarity between pairwise co-memberships of a validation dataset and class labels assigned by clustering and classification algorithms. This involved clustering tumors and comparing the results to the labels from the original classifiers.\n\n5. **Concordance Analysis**: The study performed pairwise concordance analysis between the classifiers, mapping subtypes based on observed concordance from original studies. Statistical significance was assessed using Pearson's Chi-squared test.\n\n6. **Filtering Tumors by Classification Margin**: Each subtype classifier produced a real-valued score for each subtype. Tumors with small margins (i.e., similar scores for the top two subtypes) were identified as marginally classifiable, and the analysis was repeated considering only tumors with higher margins to assess concordance.\n\n7. **Building a Consensus Classifier**: A new consensus classifier, termed consensusOV, was developed using a Random Forest algorithm trained on tumors that were concordantly classified by the three original classifiers. This classifier utilized binary gene pair vectors to standardize classification across different datasets.\n\n8. **Leave-One-Dataset-Out Cross-Validation**: The performance of the consensus classifier was assessed using leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation, where one dataset was left out for testing while the others were used for training.\n\n9. **Correlation Analysis with Histopathology and Tumor Purity**: The subtype calls from the consensus classifier were analyzed for correlation with histopathological features and tumor purity, using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).\n\n10. **Reproducibility**: The authors ensured that all results were reproducible using R/Bioconductor, and the consensusOV R package was made available for public use.\n\nOverall, the methodology emphasizes a comprehensive and systematic approach to evaluating and improving the classification of HGSOC subtypes, addressing issues of robustness and clinical applicability."

This indicates that while there is some agreement among classifiers, it is not strong.\n\n2. **Survival Association**: The subtyping classifiers were significantly associated with overall survival in a meta-analysis across datasets, suggesting that the molecular subtypes identified may have prognostic relevance.\n\n3. **Robustness Issues**: Current subtypes did not meet statistical criteria for robustness when re-clustered across multiple datasets, with a Prediction Strength of less than 0.6. This indicates that the classifiers may not reliably categorize tumors when applied to new data.\n\n4. **Development of a Consensus Classifier**: The authors developed a new consensus classifier (consensusOV) that integrates the classifications from multiple methods. This classifier was trained on tumors that were concordantly classified by existing classifiers and demonstrated improved concordance and robustness.\n\n5. **Identification of Unclassifiable Tumors**: The study highlighted that a subset of tumors could not be classified into existing subtypes, emphasizing the complexity and heterogeneity of HGSOC.\n\n6. **Correlation with Clinical Variables**: The consensus classifier correlated with patient age, survival, tumor purity, and lymphocyte infiltration, suggesting that it may provide clinically relevant insights.\n\n7. **Implications for Clinical Application**: The findings suggest that while molecular subtypes of HGSOC are associated with survival outcomes, the lack of robust and universally accepted classification hampers their clinical utility.

It highlights the complexity and challenges in accurately characterizing these subtypes, which are crucial for improving treatment and clinical outcomes.\n\nKey points from the literature review include:\n\n1. **Initial Efforts and Findings**: Early large-scale studies aimed at classifying HGSOC did not yield reproducible subtypes. Tothill et al. identified four distinct subtypes based on gene expression, each associated with different clinical features and prognoses. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) also identified four subtypes but did not find significant differences in patient survival among them.\n\n2. **Controversy and Validation**: The robustness and clinical relevance of these subtypes have been debated. Some studies have reported inconsistencies in subtype identification and prognostic significance across different patient cohorts, indicating a lack of consensus in the field.\n\n3. **Challenges in Comparison**: A review of HGSOC subtyping highlighted difficulties in comparing results due to the use of different algorithms and definitions of molecular subtypes. This inconsistency hampers the application of expression data in clinical trial designs.\n\n4. **Need for Robustness**: The review emphasizes the importance of validating subtyping algorithms in independent datasets to establish their robustness. Previous studies have not consistently reported quantitative measures such as classification accuracy or concordance rates.\n\n5. **Current Limitations**: The existing subtyping methods have shown moderate concordance and do not meet established standards for robustness. The review suggests that many tumors remain unclassifiable under current definitions, which complicates the clinical application of these subtypes.\n\n6. **Proposed Solutions**: The authors propose that a consensus classifier could improve the classification of HGSOC by integrating multiple subtyping methods and allowing for the identification of tumors that do not fit neatly into defined categories.\n\nOverall, the literature review underscores the complexity of HGSOC subtyping, the need for standardized definitions and methods, and the potential for a consensus approach to enhance clinical relevance and treatment strategies."

      "answer": "The findings of the paper \"Consensus on Molecular Subtypes of High-grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma\" present several contradictions with previous research in the field of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) subtyping.\n\n1. **Robustness of Subtypes**: The paper highlights that previously proposed subtypes do not meet established standards of robustness when subjected to re-clustering across multiple datasets, with Prediction Strength values below the threshold of 0.8 that indicates robust clusters. This contrasts with earlier studies that reported distinct subtypes with prognostic significance, suggesting that those subtypes were more reliable than the current analysis indicates.\n\n2. **Concordance Among Classifiers**: The authors found that while the proposed four distinct subtypes of HGSOC showed significant concordance and association with patient survival, the overall concordance among the classifiers was only moderate (23% to 45% for all-way concordance). This finding contradicts earlier studies that suggested a more consistent classification across different subtyping algorithms.\n\n3. **Survival Analysis**: The paper reports clear survival differences among subtypes when analyzed in independent datasets, which is a point of contention with previous research that had inconsistent findings regarding the survival differences among subtypes. Some earlier studies did not find significant survival differences, which raises questions about the reliability of those findings compared to the current analysis.\n\n4. **Indeterminate Cases**: The authors emphasize that a significant proportion of tumors (approximately one-third) are classified as indeterminate or ambiguous by existing classifiers. This finding suggests that the previous studies may have overestimated the number of tumors that can be confidently classified into distinct subtypes, leading to potential misinterpretations of the clinical relevance of these subtypes.\n\n5. **Consensus Classifier Development**: The introduction of a new consensus classifier (consensusOV) that aims to improve classification by allowing some tumors to remain unclassified is a novel approach that contrasts with the earlier attempts to assign all tumors to specific subtypes. This indicates a shift in understanding the complexity of HGSOC and the limitations of previous classification methods.\n\nIn summary, the paper presents a more cautious and nuanced view of HGSOC subtyping, highlighting issues of robustness, concordance, and the clinical applicability of previously defined subtypes, which contradicts earlier research that may have presented a more optimistic picture of subtype classification."
