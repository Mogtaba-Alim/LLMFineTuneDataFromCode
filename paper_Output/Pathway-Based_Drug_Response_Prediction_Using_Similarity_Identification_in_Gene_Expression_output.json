Concurrent treatment with these drugs with a response rate of almost 60% proved a higher efficacy of combination therapy with respect to lapatinib and trastuzumab as monotherapies (Baselga et al., 2012)., However there is a need to identify the non-responders to further improve the rate of treatment response in HER2 Cbreast cancer patients., Stratification of responders and non-responders to lapatinib trastuzumab, and their combination therapies was conducted using either gene-based or pathway (or gene set)-based approaches., In gene-based approaches mutation,  amplification, or expression of individual genes with known association with HER2Cbreast tumor biology was investigated as potential biomarkers of response to these therapies (Gomez et al., 2007,  Bianchini et al.,  2011,  Dave et al.,  2011,  Loibl et al.,  2014,  Schneeweiss et al., 2014,  Vici et al.,  2014,  Menyhart et al.,  2015)., In spite of successful studies as part of gene- based analysis they could not capture the whole picture of resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies in HER2 C breast cancer patients due to the complexity of HER2 C tumor biology (Nahta, 2012,  de Melo Gagliato et al.,  2016,  Zhang et al.,  2017)., Hence pathway (or gene set) approaches were conducted trying to identify the association of multiple genes or pathways to therapy response in HER2 Cbreast cancer patients., The association of biological pathways to treatment response in HER2Cbreast cancer patients has been conducted based on pathway enrichment analysis using individual genes identified either (1) based on higher activity in responders (or non- responders) versus non-responders (or responders) (Wu et al., 2012,  Boulbes et al.,  2015,  Nam et al., 2015) or (2) as individual or multigene biomarkers of response (Harris et al.,  2007, Willis et al.,  2018)., Here we present an alternative approach where pathways are used directly as features for predicting treatment response in HER2Cbreast cancer patients., In this study we used our recent Similarity Identification in Gene Expression (SIGN) approach (Madani Tonekaboni et al., 2019) as a classifier relying on expression patterns in biological pathways for the classification of patient tumor samples to predict the response of cancer patients in each arm of the NeoALTTO clinical trial., We showed that the transcriptional similarity coefficient (TSC) identified comparing each patient tumor sample to responders versus non-responders, can be used to identify new pathway-based biomarkers of drug response in HER2Cbreast cancer patients., MATERIALS AND METHODS The overall design of our study is illustrated in Figure 1 . In brief we used the similarity of patterns of gene expression in biological pathways from patients responding to lapatinib, trastuzumab, and their combination to predict therapy response using our SIGN methodology (Madani Tonekaboni et al., 2019)., In this framework a leave-one-out cross-validation was used to assess the performance of each biomarker in predicting the response of cancer patients in each treatmentcategory ( Figure 1 )., The data and detailed methods are described below. Gene Expression Profiles of Tumor Samples RNA-seq raw data of tumor samples in the NeoALTTO clinical trial were quantified with Kallisto (Bray et al., 2016) in Toil pipeline (Vivian et al., 2017) using the GENCODE version 23 (ALL version) transcriptome annotation., Transcript level abundances are summarized to gene level using the same approach as described in Soneson et al., (2015). Clinical Definition of Responders Versus Non-responders Responders and non-responders in the NeoALTTO clinical trial were determined using the rate of pathological complete response (pCR) (Baselga et al., 2012)., Any patient without a recorded pCR was regarded as a non-responder. A pathological complete response is defined as no invasive cancer in the breast or only non-invasive in situ cancer in the breast specimen., Surgical breast and axillary node resection specimens were evaluated for pathologic tumor response according to the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) guidelines1., Unsupervised Clustering Similarities of samples within each arm of the NeoALTTO clinical trial were identified using Spearmans rank-order correlation (Wissler, 1905)., The hierarchical clustering was then implemented on the similarity matrix between the samples using Euclidean distance and Wards minimum variance method (Murtagh and Legendre, 2014)., Univariate Biomarker Discovery Using Genes Concordance indices between the expression of each gene and the binarized vector of drug response were calculated as the prediction performance of each gene as a univariate biomarker., The significance of each identified C-index was calculated using a permutation test. The observations were randomly permuted and the C-index between the expression of each gene and the observed classes for the tumor samples was calculated., Then the fraction of times in which the C-index of the gene expression with real observed classes was lower than the C-indices identified with permuted observed classes was considered as the significance (or FDR) of the C-index identified for that gene., Concordance Index We used the concordance index (C-index) to quantify the predictive value of our drug response predictors., The C-index estimates the probability that for a pair of randomly chosen comparable samples, the sample with the higher 1https, //clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT00553358 Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org 2 September 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1016 fgene-11-01016 September 7, 2020 Time,  18, 48 # 3 Madani Tonekaboni et al., Pathway Based Drug Response Prediction FIGURE 1 | Design of the study regarding identification of responders to lapatinib, trastuzumab,  and their combination therapy in the NeoALTTO clinical trial., BP  MF,  and CC stand for the Gene Ontology (GO) terms for biological processes, molecular functions,  and cellular components,  respectively., predicted value will experience an event before the other sample or belongs to a higher binary class (Harrell et al., 1982)., We used the implementation of the concordance index available in the survcomp R package (version 1.34.0) (Schroder et al., 2011)., Transcriptional Similarity Coefficient The transcriptional similarity coefficient (TSC) between each sample and the responders and non-responders were identified using the TSC function in the SIGN R package (version 0.1.0) (Madani Tonekaboni et al., 2019)., Let Pbe the matrix of expression of genes within a pathway for a set of biological samples where rows are genes and columns are samples., Then the TSC is defined as follows TSC.P1P2/D/summationtext i.P10\u0002P20/ii/radicalbigg/radicalBig/summationtext ij.P10/2 ij/radicalBig/summationtext ij.P20/2 ij where P1and P2represent the matrix of gene expressions of a given pathway in two sets of samples (populations 1 and 2), iis the row index (i.e., gene index) within Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org 3 September 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1016 fgene-11-01016 September 7, 2020 Time,  18, 48 # 4 Madani Tonekaboni et al., Pathway Based Drug Response Prediction each matrix jis the column index (i.e., sample index) within each matrix, and Pm0 (either P10 or P20) Pm0DPm\u0002P0 m\u0000Diagonal .Pm\u0002P0 m/ where mis either 1 for population 1 or 2 for population 2., Deducting the diagonal elements in the above equation was initially proposed to the bioinformatics community for analyzing genomics data (Smilde et al., 2009)., This term will make sure that the identified similarities do not depend on the number of samples compared between the datasets., The TSC captures the similarity of the pathway expression pattern between two samples and/or sample sets that is in the range [\u00001, 1]., Identifying Responders Using TSC The TSC for each pathway was identified between one sample and the remaining samples, divided into two groups of responders and non-responders (Baselga et al.,  2012)., GO terms in level C5 with 10 to 30 genes are used in this study to identify the similarity between samples based on their gene expression pattern (Madani Tonekaboni et al., 2019)., We limited the number of genes in GO terms to exclude large GO terms (at the top of the GO term hierarchy) that are parents of the GO terms in our study (at the bottom of the GO hierarchy)., If the TSC for similarity for the responders was higher than that for the non-responders the given sample was considered as a responder and vice versa ., This process was repeated for every given sample in each arm of the trial. The methods performance for predicting the response of cancer patients was assessed using the concordance index., Cross-Validation in Predictive Models Each model was validated using leave-one-out cross-validation. In this setting a target sample was put aside, and the rest of the samples were used for the prediction of drug response in the target sample., The TSC of each pathway between the set-aside sample and the randomly selected five samples from responders and non-responders were calculated., Then the median of the TSCs of all the pathways was calculated to assess if the sample has a higher similarity to responders or non-responders., This process was repeated 100 times for each sample and majority votes of the 100 times were considered as the predicted class of the sample to be responder or non-responder., RESULTS We leveraged the gene expression and clinical information of HER2Cbreast cancer patients in the NeoALTTO clinical trial to identify biomarkers of drug response., The NeoALTTO clinical trial was a phase three randomized clinical trial designed to assess the efficacy of anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib, and their combination therapies on HER2-overexpressing breast cancer patients., The response (pCR) rate was significantly higher in the group given lapatinib and trastuzumab (51.3%) than in the group giventrastuzumab alone (29.5%, p<0.05)., However no significant difference in pCR between the lapatinib (24.7%) and the trastuzumab ( p= 0.34) groups was observed., We identified correlations of tumor samples based on their gene expression profiles in three arms of the clinical trial separated based on the treatment type including trastuzumab alone, lapatinib alone,  and their combination therapies (Figure 1 )., The unsupervised clustering of samples could not stratify the patients based on their responses relying on the rate of pathological complete response ( Figure 2A )., We further computed the C-index of genes as univariate biomarkers of drug response in each arm of the NeoALTTO trial., Relying on the common knowledge on ER being one of the main drivers in breast cancer development and progression (Fuqua, 1997),  we stratified our analyses based on the ER status., Top predictors of response yield a C-index of 0.68 ( Figure 2B ) while the C-index of ERBB2 as a univariate biomarker of response in all the arms does not exceed 0.59 (the full list can be found in the Supplementary Material )., The low performance of univariate modeling could be due to high correlation of patient tumor samples, as more than 90% of the tumor sample pairs had Pearson correlation of more than 0.9 using their gene expression profiles., We recently showed the high performance of a new method called SIGN in predicting the survival rate of breast cancer patients under different therapeutic regimens (Madani Tonekaboni et al., 2019)., We sought to use SIGN to predict the drug response of patients in each arm of the NeoALTTO trial. We used C-indices of the pathways identified between the TSC of the pathways and the drug response in each arm of the trial, to cluster the arms., Trastuzumab alone and the combination therapy arms were clustered more closely compared to the lapatinib alone arm using the C-indices of the pathways, although the difference is not significant ( p>0.05) ( Figure 3A )., Moreover the pathway biomarkers of ER \u0000and ERCpatient tumors showed low commonality revealing differences in the mechanism of response caused by the ER status of the patient tumors (absolute Spearman correlation <0.08) ( Figure 3B )., Top pathway biomarkers for patients with the same treatment regimen and ER status had C-indices of more than 0.8 except for ER\u0000patients under trastuzumab alone therapy ( Figure 3C )., Although the biological function of the identified pathways as biomarkers of drug response requires experimental validation, we found some evidence on their biological relevance., For example among top identified biomarkers of drug response, there are REGULATION OF INTERFERON GAMMA BIOSYNTHETIC PROCESS and NEGATIVE T-CELL SELECTION for ER \u0000and ERCcancer patients under lapatinib treatment, respectively., These are in agreement with previous literature on the importance of immune signaling in lapatinib response in cancer patients (Griguolo et al., 2019)., Comparison With Other Machine Learning Models We compared the top seven biomarkers identified in each arm of the NeoALTTO clinical trial for patients with ER \u0000or ERCstatus with the performance of 35 machine learning models ( Figure 4 )., Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org 4 September 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1016 fgene-11-01016 September 7, 2020 Time,  18, 48 # 5 Madani Tonekaboni et al., Pathway Based Drug Response Prediction FIGURE 2 | Identifying responders to lapatinib trastuzumab, and their combination therapy in the NeoALTTO clinical trial using genes as univariate predictors of response., (A)Clustering of samples based on their similarity defined as the Spearman correlation between gene expression profiles of the sample., (B)Top 10 genes as univariate biomarkers of drug response in ER+ and ER cohorts within each arm of the NeoALTTO clinical trial., These models were built using five different machine learning algorithms including logistic regression,  k-nearest-neighbor (k-NN),  naive Bayes,  random forest, and support vectormachine (SVM),  and seven different feature selection approaches (Figure 4 )., SIGN-based biomarkers outperformed all 35 models in all treatment categories.

DISCUSSION We propose SIGN as a new approach to identify biomarkers of drug response in other subtypes of breast cancer or other tumor types., We showed the utility of SIGN in predicting the response of HER2 Cbreast cancer patients to lapatinib, trastuzumab, and their combination therapies using transcription patterns within biological pathways., Our results further emphasize the information gainedupon using genes within biological pathways instead of individual markers of drug response., Furthermore it suggests transcriptional similarity coefficient (TSC) as a new measure of similarity between tumor samples to be used in predicting their response to drug response., SIGN-based biomarkers outperformed 35 different machine learning models in predicting drug response in each treatment category., Moreover the SIGN approach provides us with highly interpretable pathway-based biomarkers of drug response., Although SIGN showed promising performance for predicting response to lapatinib trastuzumab, and their combination in HER2Cbreast cancer patients, this approach needs further validation to ensure its generalizability in new clinical datasets., Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org 7 September 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1016 fgene-11-01016 September 7, 2020 Time,  18, 48 # 8 Madani Tonekaboni et al., Pathway Based Drug Response Prediction Upon having access to further clinical data of HER2 Cpatients in each one of these treatment categories, our findings in this study can be further assessed and validated., DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT The datasets generated for this study can be found in the ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier, NCT00553358., AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS SM led the project and performed the computational analysis of the work under supervision of BH-K.

      "question": "What is the main objective of the research in this paper?",
      "answer": "The main objective of the research in this paper is to identify biomarkers that can predict the response of HER2-positive breast cancer patients to targeted therapies, specifically lapatinib and trastuzumab, using gene expression profiles. The study aims to demonstrate that pathway-based approaches, particularly through the use of transcriptional similarity coefficients, can provide a more accurate prediction of drug response compared to traditional gene-based methods.

      "question": "Can you summarize the abstract of the paper?",
      "answer": "The abstract of the paper discusses the challenges in predicting drug responses in HER2-positive breast cancer patients treated with targeted therapies such as lapatinib and trastuzumab. Despite improvements in survival rates, a significant portion of patients do not respond to these treatments. The study aims to identify biomarkers for predicting drug response using gene expression profiles. It highlights that while univariate gene expression-based biomarkers are significant, they are weak predictors. In contrast, the study demonstrates that pathway activities derived from gene expression data, quantified through a transcriptional similarity coefficient (TSC), provide a high predictive value for therapy response. The research indicates that machine learning models based on traditional algorithms performed worse than the pathway-based approach. Ultimately, the findings suggest that transcriptional similarity of biological pathways can effectively predict responses to lapatinib and trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer patients."

(2020) involves several key steps aimed at predicting drug response in HER2-positive breast cancer patients based on gene expression profiles. Here is a detailed description of the methodology:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: The study utilized RNA-seq raw data from tumor samples collected during the NeoALTTO clinical trial, which evaluated the efficacy of lapatinib, trastuzumab, and their combination in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.\n\n2. **Gene Expression Profiling**: The raw RNA-seq data was processed using Kallisto for quantification, and transcript-level abundances were summarized to gene-level using established methods.\n\n3. **Clinical Definition of Responders vs. Non-responders**: Patients were classified as responders or non-responders based on the rate of pathological complete response (pCR). A pCR indicates no invasive cancer in the breast or only non-invasive cancer present.\n\n4. **Unsupervised Clustering**: The researchers performed unsupervised clustering of tumor samples using Spearman's rank-order correlation to identify similarities among samples. Hierarchical clustering was then applied to the similarity matrix using Euclidean distance and Ward's minimum variance method.\n\n5. **Univariate Biomarker Discovery**: The study calculated concordance indices (C-indices) for individual genes to assess their predictive performance as univariate biomarkers of drug response. The significance of these C-indices was determined through permutation tests.\n\n6. **Transcriptional Similarity Coefficient (TSC)**: The authors introduced the TSC as a measure of similarity between gene expression patterns in biological pathways. The TSC was calculated for each pathway comparing samples from responders and non-responders.\n\n7. **Identifying Responders Using TSC**: The TSC was used to classify each sample as a responder or non-responder based on the similarity of pathway expression patterns. If the TSC for a sample was higher when compared to responders than non-responders, it was classified as a responder.\n\n8. **Cross-Validation**: A leave-one-out cross-validation approach was employed to validate the predictive models. For each sample, the TSC was calculated against a subset of samples, and the majority vote from multiple iterations determined the predicted class.\n\n9. **Comparison with Machine Learning Models**: The performance of the SIGN-based pathway biomarkers was compared against 35 different machine learning models, including logistic regression, naive Bayes, random forest, k-nearest neighbor, and support vector machine, to evaluate their predictive capabilities.\n\n10. **Statistical Analysis**: The concordance index was used to quantify the predictive value of the drug response predictors, and statistical significance was assessed throughout the analysis.\n\nOverall, the methodology emphasizes the use of pathway-based approaches and transcriptional similarity to enhance the prediction of drug responses in HER2-positive breast cancer, demonstrating the potential of the SIGN methodology in clinical applications."

The study utilized data from the NeoALTTO clinical trial, which tested the efficacy of lapatinib, trastuzumab, and their combination. The authors found that the SIGN-based biomarkers outperformed various machine learning models in predicting drug response.\n\nThe results indicated that transcriptional similarity of biological pathways could effectively predict responses to lapatinib and trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.

      "question": "Are there any contradictions between this paper's findings and previous research?",
      "answer": "The findings of the paper by Madani Tonekaboni et al. (2020) indicate that pathway-based drug response prediction using transcriptional similarity coefficients (TSC) provides a more effective method for predicting responses to lapatinib and trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer patients compared to traditional univariate gene expression-based biomarkers and various machine learning models. \n\nIn contrast to previous research, which often relied on individual gene-based approaches to identify biomarkers of drug response, this study highlights the limitations of such methods. For instance, the authors note that univariate gene expression-based biomarkers were significant but weak predictors of drug response, with C-indices not exceeding 0.68 for top predictors. This suggests that previous studies, which may have focused on single-gene analyses, did not capture the complexity of resistance mechanisms in HER2-positive breast cancer.\n\nMoreover, the paper emphasizes that while combination therapies like lapatinib and trastuzumab have shown improved response rates (approximately 60% in the NeoALTTO trial), a significant proportion of patients (40%) still did not respond. This finding aligns with earlier studies indicating that not all patients with HER2 amplification respond to these therapies, but it also underscores the need for better predictive models, which the authors claim to address through their pathway-based approach.\n\nIn summary, the paper contradicts previous research by demonstrating that pathway-based approaches, which consider the collective activity of multiple genes within biological pathways, yield higher predictive power for drug response than traditional single-gene analyses. This suggests a shift in focus from individual gene markers to pathway-level insights in understanding treatment responses in HER2-positive breast cancer."
