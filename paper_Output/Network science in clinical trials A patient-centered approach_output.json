Beyond discussing the challenges of high-throughput technologies this review will develop a framework on how to implement a network science approach in new clinical trial designs in order to advance cancer care., 1. Introduction In preclinical and clinical cancer research there is an increasing use of molecular throughput-technologies enabling us to leverage large quantities of molecular data., This is enhancing our knowledge of de- regulated oncogenic pathways due to alterations at the genomic, tran- scriptomic and protein level [ 1, 2, 3 ]., This massive amount of data re- presents a challenge for the scienti fic community in terms of finding a relevant integrated approach capturing the dynamics and functional heterogeneity of metabolomics, transcriptomics and genomics [ 4, 5, 6 ] in several di fferent cellular compartments and locations of the same tumor and in the same patient., The use of such networks and the development of gene-regulatory protein-protein and human disease networks provide a promising tool to allow high-throughput network analysis [ 7]., A network science ap- proach aims to capture the systemic nature of human disease as awhole including the immune-system which represent an illustrativeexample where a network science approach can provide an added value [8, 9, 10, 11 ]., The use of network science is rarely used in drug development and not explored yet in the clinical trial setting., This may be related to knowledge gaps between clinicians scientists and regulatory o fficials on this matter [ 12, 13 ]., What can we learn from network science and how should this be applied in drug development and in a clinical trial setting?, This review aims to illustrate the most important concepts of network science and discusses emerging biological concepts wherein network science approaches are essential for a thorough understanding of cancer biology and its applicability in a clinical-trial context., We will argue that a network science approach is to be considered as a next step facilitating the integration of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and other omics including morphology in drug development on the one hand and on the other hand into a patient-centered context in clinical trials., https//doi.org/10.1016/j.semcancer.2017.12.006 Received 20 September 2017, Received in revised form 12 December 2017,  Accepted 13 December 2017Corresponding author at, Bioinformatics and Computational Genomics Laboratory,  Princess Margaret Cancer Center,  Toronto, ON,  Canada., 1Equal Authorship.E-mail address bhaibeka@uhnresearch.ca (B.

Non-linearity of tumor dynamics Cancer may be viewed as a complex and a heterogeneous disease resulting in uncontrolled growth of cells within the body., Some of the reasons include (but are not limited to) genetic changes epigenetic alterations, micro-environmental variations, carcinogenic agents ex- posure and abnormalities in several key molecular functions in a cell [14, 15 ]., Carcinogenesis is generally viewed as an evolutionary process because the pre-malignant lesions have to undergo several mutations inorder to become malignant cells [ 16, 17, 18 ]., The complexity and het- erogeneity of carcinogenesis can be explained through somatic evolu-tion where the process of cancer initiation and progression is governed through evolutionary mechanisms [ 16, 17, 18 ]., The advent of mutated clones and their fitness is controlled to some extent by its micro-en- vironment, for example,  the proliferative capacity (also, termed as the fitness) of a cell is a function of micro- and macro-environmental con- ditions in the tumor such as oxygen and metabolic nutrients in thesystem., In a study by Bozic et al. [ 19] the authors have shown that driver mutations confer a fitness advantage in glioblastoma and pan- creatic cancers during tumor progression [ 19]., This drives the fact that tumor microenvironment confers a fitness advantage to tumor cells eventually leading to invasion of neighboring tissue., The technological improvements in sequencing technologies has enabled comprehensive characterization of the mutational landscape for various solid tumors including breast [ 20], brain [ 21],  [ 22],  lung [23],  pancreatic [ 24] and ovarian cancers [ 25, 26 ]., In the multi-step process of carcinogenesis many di fferent types of mutations must occur before a cell turns malignant, and this has been already studied in the past [ 27, 28 ]., This leads to the altered regulation of oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes eventually resulting in thedysfunction of di fferent molecular pathways involving these a ffected genes [ 29]., These molecular pathways represent several biological processes relating to proliferation cellular metabolism,  immune sig- nalling,  epithelial-mesenchymal transition and many others., Several studies have supported the fact that tumor microenvironmental con- ditions such as hypoxia, could potentially a ffect the gene regulation and alters the landscape of molecular pathways [ 30]., Furthermore the spatial and temporal dynamics of these conditions determine the functional behaviour of the phenotype., For example the glucose and oxygen concentrations in the tumor continuously vary over space and time [ 31], which has a detrimental e ffect on the metabolic pathways in the tumor., In order to understand how a malignant lesion is function-ally di fferent from a normal tissue over space and time, it is necessary to assess the complete landscape of signalling interactions rather thanrelying on the individual pathways., Due to the fact that dynamics of cancer being highly nonlinear (defined as those changing conditions that do not occur in a linear way) in both space and time, one has to rely on network science and systemsbiology based approaches.2.2., Network science and systems biology Systems biology is a research that focusses on the computational and mathematical methods which are supported by the underlying fundamental biological principles., While network science is a field that focuses on the theoretical aspects of networks between biological en- tities, such as molecules,  proteins,  genes,  etc., Using network science we can model the cellular interactions across biological entities and apply systems biology techniques to address fundamental questions related to these interactions., In the molecular biology landscape complex intercellular and in- tracellular signalling interactions contribute to the functioning of sev- eral biological processes in a cell., This has facilitated the need to decode complex phenotypic traits in the tumor using biological networks, causing a paradigm shift in modelling these complex interactions [ 32]., The basic premise of these biological networks is that many compo-nents in the system interact with each other in a nonlinear and non- additive manner., These networks can help us elucidate the spatial and temporal mechanisms behind the complex dynamics of biological sys- tems., The availability of transcriptional data allows one to focus on the large-scale networks of interacting genes, rather than solely relying on individual genes or components of a system., Fig. 1 displays a schematic diagram of an undirected network (where causal relationships/edge directions between nodes are ig- nored) and a directed network (where causality/edge directionality between nodes is accounted)., 2.2.1. Types of biological networks Biological networks can be broadly classi fied into two categories namely,  causal networks and association networks., The causal re- lationships between two random variables or nodes can be captured using a causal interaction network., For example a set of genes that influence a given gene s expression level can be represented using a causal interaction network., On the other hand association networks aregenetic networks that capture the association between any two entities such as proteins, or genes,  or a disease-gene association., Below is a concise summary of di fferent types of networks. The relationship between various biological entities for instance,  molecules,  genes, and proteins can be e fficiently described as networks whose nodes represent these entities and edges denote the interactionsbetween these entities., The link between genes and proteins form complex cellular networks which include gene regulatory networks,  protein-protein interaction networks, metabolic networks and genetic interaction networks., In gene regulatory networks, nodes are genes and transcription factors. edges between these nodes can be either direc- tional or bi-directional which in biological terms can be either in-hibition or activation., Protein interaction networks are those networks which encode the information of proteins and their physical interac- tions., The signalling networks are those networks that capture the in- formation between signalling proteins., These networks have revealed global topological properties that relate to known biological properties., Metabolic networks capture the biochemical reactions in the cell, where Fig 1.

Edges in metabolic networks are closely related to functions of a gene and has a great potential for applications in the biological interpretation of roles of speci fic genes., Genetic association networks captures the functional relationships between genes. For ex-ample, correlation based networks describe the correlation patterns among genes, i.e. the edges between two nodes represent how corre- lated is the gene expression. Fig. 2 displays di fferent types of networks namely,  gene regulatory network, genetic interaction network,  protein-protein interaction net- work and metabolic network., In regulatory networks edges represent interactions between transcription factors and target genes. In genetic interaction networks such as correlation based networks the edges denote the statistical correlation in expression patterns (taken after a threshold on the correlation based on False Discovery Rate)., In protein- protein interaction (PPI) networks edges denote measured stable in- teractions between proteins., In metabolite networks, edges representmetabolic reactions and nodes denote compounds. A sample biological network is illustrated in Fig. 3, which displays an undirected small genetic interaction network, a co-expression net- work. Each node in the network represent a gene and the interactions in the network are the statistical correlations between the genes., In simple words the edge quanti fies the extent of similar pattern of gene expression between two conditions, or cellular phenotypes., This bio-logical network is built using gene expression pro files derived from the laser capture microdissected transcriptional measurements of ER posi-tive breast cancer patients., 2.2.2. Network descriptors The topological and statistical properties of networks can provide valuable insight into the biological processes along with the internal organisational structure of interactions., These properties can be local (for instance, looking at a sub-graph) or global to a network. The identification of important nodes in the network is a non-trivial task, Fig. 2.

However it is still a challenge to identify the nodes that drive a certain biological function, in a complex interaction network., Some of the widely known measures used to extract information from a network are degree clustering, betweenness centrality and modules or communities., Fig. 4 ce displays well known network measures. The degree (de fined as the number of connections) is used as a measure to indicate the importance of a node., For example, in Fig. 4c the degree of the red color node is four. Edge-betweenness is defi ned as the degree of centralization in a network, i.e. this measure describes the number of times a node appears in the shortest path of all pairs of nodes in the biological network., There are various betweenness centrality measures and a comparison of these can be found elsewhere [ 37]., Many clustering algorithms have been proposed in the literature to identify groups of nodes that participate in the same functional process [38]., For instance clustering based approaches to PPI networks are broadly categorized into topology-free (which do not consider distancebetween proteins) and graph-based (considers topology of the net- work)., However, the recent work by Padi et al. [ 39] suggests that a single network cannot capture the complete landscape of molecularinteractions and an appropriate network score is required that can be applied across di fferent types of networks., Communities are defi ned as a group of nodes that have dense connections within a community andsparse connections across the communities., With regards to epi-stroma crosstalk these communities represent groups of genes from epi and stroma that are tightly connected to each other., The interactions with these highly connected nodes in each community are tightly linked together and represent speci fic biological processes., Topologically all the nodes within a community have more links to each other comparedto other nodes in other modules., Hubs in a biological network play a critical role in governing many biological processes and cellular functions., Although transcription factors are associated with high degree in the transcriptional network however,  they are not the biggest hubs in the biological network [ 39]., Also in protein interaction networks, the hubs are the proteins whichplay a central role in several cellular processes [ 40, 41 ]., Edge-be- tweenness measure has been applied on the protein interaction networkto assess the protein druggability based on pro files of the druggable targets [ 42]., Although it is widely believed that disease related elements should be a part of hubs in the biological network [ 43], however,  in a recentstudy by Platig et al., the authors demonstrated that disease associated SNP s (single nucleotide polymorphisms) are not global hubs within the network, but are local hubs pertaining to a network module [ 44]., These critical findings support the fact that non-hub genes indeed play a cri- tical role in various biological functions., Therefore the aforementionedmeasures underestimate the role of non-hub genes in the biological network [ 45]., Those nodes that can in fluence the flow of information in the network are termed as influential nodes , and these in fluential nodes can be hubs or non-hubs., Over the last few years identi fication of in fluential nodes has gained lots of interest and has numerous applications, for instance,  in disease control and in social networks., In a recent study investigators identified influential nodes which are part of the wound healing process using transcriptomic pro filing data [ 46], and Gibbs et al., in another study captured all the in fluential nodes in the yeast gene regulatory network [ 47]. Recently Morone and Makse [ 48] proposed an algorithm that e fficiently computes the optimal in fluencers that dismantles the network into smaller components and disrupts the spread of informa-tion., Although this concept has been successfully applied in the context of spread of infectious diseases there has been a void in its application to the cancer research., 3. Network science and the tumor microenvironment3.1. Tumor heterogeneity Cancer is a system of heterogeneous population of clones along with the complex web of network interactions among these clones, including with surrounding normal cells, which is termed as the intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) [ 49]., This complexity is one of the primary hurdles in understanding the evolutionary dynamics of cancer [ 50, 51 ]., The phenotypic variations along with the tumor microenvironment (TME) dictate the changes in the gene expression., The TME is composed of non-cancerous cells present in the tumor which include fibroblasts, immune cells and endothelial cells that form the blood vessels., Thecurrent targeted treatment paradigm is developed to target certain molecular aberrations based on the diagnosis carried out on the bulk tumor., Therefore it is not surprising to observe intrinsic and extrinsic drug resistance in patients [ 52, 53 ]., One better way to investigate ITH is through single cell sequencing which is discussed in the next section.Understanding the ITH will facilitate e ffective therapies that could potentially target the driving forces of the ITH., Gerlinger et al. con-structed a phylogenetic tree and showed that renal carcinoma has a branched evolutionary growth. The authors in their study also con- veyed that bulk tumor sequencing from a single biopsy leads to an under estimation of mutational burden, due to ITH [ 54]., Benerji et al. explored the signalling pathways using network entropy and observedde-differentiation of cells and demonstrated the applicability of cancer evolution in a clinical setting [ 55]., Later, Park et al. used entropy based measure at the gene level to quantify the ITH on the TCGA pan cancer cohort [ 56]., To capture the complete evolutionary landscape of ITH it is important to build biological networks based on data obtained fromthe temporal and spatial sequencing of the tumor., 3.1.1. Tumor stroma A growing body of literature has shed light into the functional and phenotypical diversity during the carcinogenesis., The tissue home- ostasis is perturbed by the mutated epithelial cells and change the surrounding microenvironment [ 57], termed as reactive stroma., The reactive stroma is characterized by a change in collagen bundles de- gradation of basement membrane and ECM remodelling [ 58]., These include recruitment and di fferentiation of immune and endothelial cells as well as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which together enhance tumor growth and metastasis., This in turn promotes aberrant cellularbehaviour and the mutated cells co-evolve along with the stromal en- vironment [ 58]., The communication between the tumor epithelial and Fig. 4.

The complexity of these inter and intracellular communications are mediated through regulatory loops between the tumor epithelial and stromal compartments., Variations in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in particular,  the tumor-associated stroma, are linked to worse clinical outcome in aggressive cancer types,  such as triple negative breast, colon,  prostate,  and ovarian cancers., Recent biological and clinical studies have recognized that tumor TME is a key contributor to cancer progression, invasion,  metastasis and resistance to therapies [ 59, 60, 61 ]., The variations in microenvironmental conditions result in the re- wiring of molecular interactions between and within biological com- partments., These rewired changes can yield novel biological insights into gain or loss of interactions speci fic to a condition., On this front a recent study used a systems biology approach and analyzed epithelial-stromal co-expression relationships between normal and tumor samples in breast cancer patients [ 62]., The authors observed the functional rewiring of self-loops (de fined as those genes that are coexpressed in both the tumor epithelium and stroma) as an important feature of breast tumorigenesis., Identi fication of the epi-stroma crosstalk sig- nature could enable us to find drugs that inhibit the epi-stroma co-de- pendencies., 3.1.2. Immunological tumor context It is apparent that the immune-system is important in the develop- ment and progression of cancer [ 63] and that the assessment of im- munological biomarkers at the morphological level tumor in filtrating lymphocytes- as well as at the cellular level are important both for prognosis as well as for prediction in a variety of tumor-types [64, 11, 65 ]., Similar approaches have been used for the analysis of adaptive immune-response in response to vaccination for example [ 66, 67 ] en- abling the analysis of individual cellular and subcellular interactions ofimmune-responses [ 68]., Chaussabel and colleagues propose an analy- tical strategy based on modular transcriptional repertoires of immune-cell constituents relying on a priori determined co-dependent gene sets., This modelling avoids the classical reductionistic approaches like hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis, that are based on similarities of gene expression rather than based on biological de- pendencies of the variables assessed [ 68]., In this respect Tan and colleagues reconstructed T-cell activation networks using phosphopro-teomic pro filing integrating multi-omics technologies and computa- tional pipelines elucidating the temporal mechanisms of exit from T-cellquiescence., This multilevel approach allowed for better sensitivity compared to single-level omics since missing data in one approach can then be complemented by other measurements, illustrating another specific characteristic of multi-level network science approaches [ 69]., Within the context of simulating the determinants of response to immunotherapeutics d Onofrio and colleagues have modelled that the response rate on immunotherapeutics and the ability of periodicallygiven treatments to remove of tumors depended on the aggressiveness of the tumor [ 70, 71 ]., The biggest caveat however of those in silico modelling approaches is that there is still uncertainty whether this merein silico modelling captures the dynamics of the interactome between tumor and immune cells., An alternative approach has been developedby Spitzer and colleagues using mass cytometry data of single immune cells from di fferent organs enabling the development of immune-re- ference maps., This was used to map the immune organisation acrossdifferent body compartments taking into account the di fferent genetic composition of the immune cells [ 10]., Using this approach an or- ganism-wide study was conducted in genetically engineered cancermodels. In this study it became evident that a coordinated systemic immune-response was necessary for optimal local response to im- munotherapeutic agents, identifying through this network-approach that CD4-T cells primed at the periphery are important to initiate tumor response., These findings illustrate that a network science approach isapplicable beyond the mere local micro-environmental setting [ 9]., The emergence of resistance to immunotherapeutic treatments needs to take into account the dynamic and continuously evolvingnature of the interactions of the immune-system with not only the tumor-cells but also with the stromal cells [ 72, 73 ]., This is illustrated in a patient with widely metastatic melanoma that had heterogeneousresponse to anti-PD1 therapy with some lesions regressing and some being resistant., Whole exome sequencing gene expression assays and immunohistochemistry for PDL1 and CD8, among others,  were applied to a set of 26 specimens (4 pre-mortem and 22 post-mortem)., It became evident that there was a remarkable similarity at the genetic and im- munological level between regressing and progressing cutaneous me- tastases, whereas gene expression pro files were able to distinguish a differential adaptive response between progressive versus responding lesions [ 74]., There is also evidence that the dynamics of the neoantigen land- scape of anti-PD1 treatment-resistant NSCLC change after an initial response, wherein loss of 7 18 mutation-associated neoantigen clones was associated with the resistant samples through the elimination oftumor subclones, altered levels of T-cell receptors or importantly through deletion of chromosomal regions containing truncal alterations [75]., Furthermore alterations at the chromosome level combined with tumor mutational load have been demonstrated to be better predictors of survival after immunotherapy than either alone [ 76]., The dynamic nature of the immune-in filtrate is also illustrated by the fact that the spatio-temporal dynamics of 28 di fferent immune cells, called as the immunome infiltrating colorectal cancer changed at tumor-progres- sion and these dynamics in fluences survival [ 77]., Immune-related gene expression signatures discriminates patients with and without metas-tases demonstrating also that immuno-cytotoxicity decreases with tumor-progression whereas other features such as driver mutations and chromosome instability were not related to the occurrence of metastasis[78]., Recently a cancer immunogram was proposed that includes the following variables, (1) Tumor Foreignness mutational load ,  (2) General Immune-status Lymphocyte count , (3) Immune cell in filtra- tion Intratumoral T-cells ,  (4) Absence of checkpoints PDL1 , (5) Absence of soluble inhibitors IL6,  CRP ,  (6) Absence of inhibitory tumor metabolism LDH, glucose utilisation and (7) Tumor sensitivity to immune e ffectors MHC-expression, IFN-gamma sensitivity [79] and references herein., The authors conclude their proposal stating that this information required from this analysis may be obtained from the combination of tumor genomics, immunohistochemistry,  and standardassays on the peripheral blood compartment ., A network science approach may thus be a critical and necessary tool to have an integrated analysis of all these variables., 3.2. High-throughput spatial OMICS Exploring the phenotypic identity in a tumor requires the gene ex- pression pro files at multiple locations in the tumor of individual phe- notypes., The following sections present an integration of network sci- ence approaches from data derived from the high-throughput sequencing of spatial composition of tumor phenotypes along with single-cell sequencing., 3.2.1. Spatial transcriptomics The clinical management of patients diagnosed with cancer remains dependent on a diligent evaluation of biopsies by pathologists., For in- stance in breast cancer, pathological evaluation is usually supple- mented by validated assays for ER,  PR, and HER2 status., Network sci- ence approaches have been developed in estrogen-receptor positive disease finding correlations between expression modules and grade and tumor size respectively, as well as with survival,  identifying hub-genesin this setting [ 80, 81 ].V.S.K., Manem et al.

However there is a pressing need to develop assays based on morphological and functional characteristics of various phenotypes in the bulk tumor., It is important to deconvolute the bulk tumor signal to various phenotypic components. In this regard spatial genomics-tran- scriptomics plays a critical role in dissecting the bulk tumor to various phenotypes such as percentage of (reactive) stroma, tumor cells,  lym- phocytes,  etc., The mapping of spatial heterogeneity of the tumor mi- croenvironment using digital pathology tools is emerging as an im- portant tool linking the morphological heterogeneity with high throughput technologies., Using spatial genomics-transcriptomics it is possible to delineate the molecular surrogates of the spatial hetero- geneous localisation of lymphocytes or proliferating tumor cells [ 82]., Multiplexed pro filing-technologies of immune-subtypes are cur- rently being developed that may potentially be used in a clinical trial setting, herewith providing a future rationale to couple spatial geno- mics to high throughput-technologies and network science-approaches., This concept will also promote further understanding of the micro- environmental heterogeneity and integration of genomic information herein., This concept can be further elaborated on by using a spatial transcriptomics approach on tissue sections whereby a co-localisation of proteins, morphological features and RNA-pro filingin situ will enable us to identify and map the spatial heterogeneity of not only the tumorcells, but as well as the spatial features of the microenvironment [ 83]i n which the immune-component is gaining tremendous importance inthis era of immunotherapeutics., Mapping the spatial features of a tumor is becoming important since drug-penetration in the stroma and con- sequent development of resistance is equally infl uenced and determined by the heterogeneity of the microenvironment [ 84, 85 ]., Integrating spatial genomics-transcriptomics into a network-science approach may lead to a more unbiased approach of the patients tumor compared to a less integrated approach wherein this variable is not taken into account., 3.2.2. Single-cell sequencing Single-cell RNA sequencing is an emerging technique that can be used to assess cell-to-cell variability at the genomic scale., Unlike bulk tumor sequencing single cell RNA sequencing provides resolution of transcriptomic details to the level of individual cells, for example,  in a highly heterogeneous cancer such as triple-negative breast cancer., Single cell sequencing technology o ffers the possibility of identifying tumor subpopulations and selecting appropriate combinations of drugsthat could potentially target each individual subpopulation, thus de- creasing chances of tumor resistance., Lee and colleagues performed single cell RNA sequencing on 10 breast cancer cells which were treated with paclitaxel., They found distinctly di fferent gene expression pro files between stressed cells and drug-tolerant cells [ 86]., They additionally studied clonal evolution of a single drug-tolerant cell by sequencing each of the cells in its sixth generation., In another study hundreds of di fferentially expressed genes were found between just 8 sequenced cells of melanoma tumor cellsusing a custom single cell RNA sequencing protocol [ 87]., Recently, Crow et al. constructed single cell co-expression network from 31 individual studies comprising 163 individual cell types, and investigated the diversity in the functional characteristics of cells [ 88]., The authors compared networks made from distinct populations ofspecific cell types to networks containing all of the cell types assayed within an experiment., In this way they assessed the e ffects of cell-state and compositional variation on functional connectivity., In their meth- odology networks were built using Spearman correlation, and each edge weight was de fined as the rank of the correlation coe fficient within the network., The degree of a node was calculated as the sum- mation of all the weights connected to a given node. Aggregation was performed by averaging ranked correlation coe fficients across net- works then re-ranking and standardizing values between 0 and 1 [ 88]., In another study, Wang et al. did a comparative study between single cell and bulk tumor gene expression pro files. They found distinct features for the co-expressed genes between single cell and bulk tumordata. Applying network principles on single cell data could potentially help us to explore the biological complexity and functional hetero-geneity within the bulk tumor at a much higher resolution., 4. Identi fication of drug targets using network science 4.1. Network pharmacology Several statistical approaches have been used to characterize the biological mechanisms of molecular interactions, however,  networks have pioneered in describing, identifying and characterizing the reg- ulatory mechanisms involved in cellular networks., By associating the topological features of networks under di fferentially expressed condi- tions one can identify putative genes that regulate the transcriptionalprogram., Another important goal in cancer research is strati fication of heterogeneous population of patients in a biologically and clinicallymeaningful manner., Creixell et al. [ 89] provided an overview of net- work-based pathway analysis which is used to infer the putative geneinteractions that vary across multiple conditions, or in normal versus malignant states., The traditional approach of drug design and discovery relied on one target-one drug . For many years this approach has in fluenced identification of actionable targets, classi fication of disease,  drug screening as well as in the design of clinical trials., Hopkins described networks as a promising tool for drug develop- ment [ 90]. This allowed a paradigm shift from the single-target to a multi-target approach with a network centric view of drug-target in-teractions., In this regard systems biology has laid down the foundation to enhance knowledge of multiple targets in cancer at multi-pathway level through networks., Networks can be used to identify multiple nodes (either genes or proteins) that can inhibit or activates a pathway to a given compound.This ideal methodology can be used to identify pathways leading to the drug resistance, and help find another synergistic compound that can act in coherence with the other drug., Recent years had seen the ap-plication of systems biology based approaches in drug design and dis- covery [ 91, 92, 93, 94 ]., Jaegar et al. used network based approach and discovered novel synergistic drug combinations in breast cancer usingthe concept of pathway crosstalk inhibition [ 95]., Halasz and colleagues describe a two-stage computational model that enables the constructionof signal transduction networks, and used to predict the therapeutic effectiveness of agents that targets the network in di fferent cells or tissues [ 96]., Network models can also be used to predict the bypass mechanisms of cancer cells when a critical node is targeted, or knocked down form the system., Astsaturov et al. [ 97] built an EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) centered protein network and identified subnetworks of proteins in fluencing resistance., 4.2. Identi fication of signalling alterations Cancer cells have the characteristic of constantly being rewired at the genetic and epigenetic level [ 98].Rewired in this context means that, tumor cells are constantly undergoing evolutionary changes at the genetic and epigenetic level, which is re flected in the inferred networks representing the various associations between the biological entities., This has as a consequence therapeutic failure as emerging resistant clones emerge over time due to changing environmental conditions and natural selection, with several di fferent mutational spectra and sub- types being identi fied [99, 100, 101, 102, 103 ]., How these mutation spectra and mutational alterations a ffect the dynamics of signalling networks is of importance for adequate drug development., It is in this regard that the concept of cancer network attractors can be introduced which is defi ned by the perturbation of signalling pathways rendering, changing or attracting the malignant phenotype [ 104]., Computational strategies have been developedV.S.K.

[105 106 ] to analyse the interaction of somatic alterations with the signalling processes within the same tumor., Performing a pan-cancer analysis on 3281 samples from 12 di fferent cancer types have elabo- rated up to 16 signi ficantly mutated subnetworks exhibiting co-occur- ring mutations across di fferent samples., Of interest it has been shown that gene expression features are more informative than mutations for prediction of response to targeted therapies [ 107]., The interaction between tissue- each with its unique microenvironment and the genomic context will determine whether apatient will respond or not to a particular treatment, i.e., having the same genetic alteration in di fferent tumor types may not elicit the same response [ 108]., Therefore models that incorporate causality between mutational findings with transcriptomics on the one hand and pro- teomics on the other hand are urgently needed [ 5]., This has particular importance for finding druggable targets in tumor types that have rare and low frequency mutated genes, wherein the use of other non-net-work science may probably be suboptimal for this purpose., Creixell and colleagues have named signalling altering mutations as network attacking mutations (NAMs) [ 109]., Using a set of ovarian cancer cell lines cancer genome repositories and a computationalplatform called ReKINect they have defi ned three classes of NAMs, (1) NAMs that disrupt signalling network dynamics by constitutively acti-vating a protein kinase, thereby maintaining the information flowon oroffuninterrupted over time, (2) NAMs that rewire upstream or downstream interactions,  either of the mutated protein or node, and,  (3) NAMs that destroy or generate phosphorylation sites, generating new molecular gates in cells., Conceptually they correlate with node inactivation/activation as loss-of-function mutations and gain-of-func- tion mutations, illustrating the translation of classical mutation termi- nology into node-network science type of terminology., Using this approach they have identi fied previously unknown phosphorylation sites supporting the hypothesis that cancer cells can acquire novel signalling flows leading to new phenotypic states., This approach illustrates an important caveat in current research namely the genomic interpretation at the signalling level of the network-at- tacking mutations., In summary network biology is a useful tool in identi fication of actionable targets and at the same time could potentially decrease the failure rates in the drug discovery., 5. Network science approach from the bench to the clinic5.1. Current paradigms for precision-medicine studies Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been for decades the gold standard for clinical research and represent the backbone of regulatory approvals for novel therapies., Limitations of RCTs such as study dura- tion large sample size, statistical challenges in speci fic subgroups and cost have contributed to the emergence of adaptive designs [ 110]., Four case studies are illustrated in the review by Bhatt et al seamless phase 23 design, sample size reestimation,  changing the primary endpoint, and biomarker-driven adaptive population-enrichment designs., The latter design applies to current-day oncology after the emer- gence of high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies that led to themolecular characterization of most histological cancer types., Indeed highly active targeted agents in a setting of oncogene addiction have resulted in some cases in regulatory approvals following the results of phase 1 clinical trials [ 111] while other target-drug combinations still needed evidence from phase 3 RCTs before regulatory approvals [112, 113 ]., These somatic activating alterations in oncogene addiction settings remain however rare and represent a major obstacle when designing pivotal clinical trials., Indeed the example of the neuro- trophic tyrosine receptor kinases NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3 fusions are prevalent mechanisms of oncogenic activation of this receptor tyr- osine kinase family [ 114] while therapies in this setting yield en- couraging response rates [ 115]., Thus the need for transformativeclinical trial designs. Two notable examples are the histology-based clinical trial design to evaluate multiple molecular biomarkers also known as the umbrella trial, and the histology-independent, aberra- tion-speci fic clinical trial also known as the basket trial [ 116]., Umbrella trials serve to tackle the paradigm of common cancers becoming rare and notable examples are the BATTLE study in NSCLC[117] and SAFIR-01 in breast cancer [ 118]., This was made possible since the mutational landscapes of the most prevalent cancer types havebeen deciphered and new molecular classi fications have been identi fied [119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124 ], allowing potential strati fication to treat- ments with multiple drugs in one clinical trial enrolling the patients with one histological type., Patients with a detected genomic alteration are randomized to a standard therapy chemotherapy in most cases,  versus the genomically-informed targeted agent., An ongoing example is the lung-MAP trial in the second line treatment of squamous cell lung cancer with multiple randomized sub-studies within the principal stu- dies ( http, //www.lung-map.org )., Other trials such as SAFIR-02 in breast cancer studies the precision medicine paradigm by randomizingpatients to 2 arms, a standard maintenance therapy arm versus main- tenance therapy using a genomically-informed targeted agent (NCT02299999)., Umbrella trials match patients to targeted agents based on single genomic alterations (hotspot mutations, copy-numbervariations,  rearrangements,  gene-expression pro files)., A few trials also include potential immune response predictors such as mismatch repairdeficiency immunohistochemistry ( http, //www.focus4trial.org/ aboutfocus4/focus4trialschema )., At the other end of the spectrum the same genomic alterations can occur in a variety of cancer types [ 125]., These genomic alterations are however rare by cancer type leading to the design of basket trials testing one biological agent targeting the same molecular alteration indifferent tumor types., One example of a basket trial in orphan dis- eases is the EORTC-CREATE trial testing crizotinib (MET and ALK in-hibitor) in tumor types as rare as anaplastic large cell lymphoma, in-flammatory myo fibroblastic tumor,  papillary renal cell carcinoma type I, alveolar soft part sarcoma,  clear cell sarcoma and alveolar rhabdo- myosarcoma (NCT01524926)., Many such trials have already been re- ported such as PARP inhibitors in patients with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations with di fferent tumor types [ 126] and BRAF inhibitors in tumors harboring the BRAF V600 hotspot mutation [ 127]., Such studies have yielded so far mitigated results because the pa- tient and tumor contexts mattered beyond the detection of a potentialoncogenic alteration., Indeed feedback activation of EGFR was identi- fied as a mechanism of resistance to BRAF inhibitor monotherapy in colorectal cancer harboring BRAF V600E mutations [ 128], explaining the absence of e fficacy of single agent BRAF inhibitors in this setting., Other innate or acquired mechanisms of resistance could explain re-sistance to single-agent BRAF inhibitors in other tumor types., Vemur- afenib was therefore combined with cetuximab a monoclonal antibody targeting EGFR, in the colorectal cancer cohort of the vemurafenib basket trial [ 127]., The current development of basket trials sup- ports the concept of agnostic clinical trial design [ 129], based on the targeting of one single genomic biomarker., 5.2. Limitations with the current approaches The example of BRAF mutations in colorectal cancer highlights the complexity of the contexts in the prediction of drug e fficacy and a non-exhaustive list of contextual variables include, co-occurring so- matic genomic alterations, germline mutations harbored by the patient (both disease-predisposing and pharmacogenomic), immune cell in-filtration and the stroma,  epigenetics,  expression and proteomics, sanctuary sites of metastases., An adaptive clinical trial design using systems to transversally in- corporate contextual components could help overcome the reduc- tionist paradigm [130]., Indeed multiple feedbacks and crosstalks between signalling pathways can mediate therapeutic escape and theV.S.K., Manem et al.

All rights reserved. interaction of drug targets with other protein can determine a dis- crepancy in tumor response in di fferent tumor types., However despite many examples of successful adaptive trials in cancer medicine such asI-SPY2 for example [ 131, 132 ],  the same reductionist approach con- tinues to be applied., The reductionist approach is also challenged byheterogeneity and branched evolution [ 54]. Sequential strategies in- cluding re-challenges [ 133] and new generation of targeted agents [134] are used to overcome acquired resistance mechanisms and could be incorporated longitudinally in an adaptive clinical trial design basedon systems biology., A recent example demonstrates the potential of integrating parallel (phospho)proteomic and mRNA sequencing data to interpret the context-speci fic impact of somatic alterations in PIK3CA- mutant cell lines in terms of functional signatures such as (phospho)protein and transcription factor activities, supporting the incorporation of multiple functional readouts in a systematic strati fication of tumors beyond single driver mutations [ 129, 105 ]., The massive generation of data provided by next-generation se- quencing currently integrated in publicly available databases [ 135], could serve to infer functional genomic approaches that will be in- tegrated in a computational framework applied to select candidate targets for biomarker-driven trials., The candidate targets would then be studied in cell lines and animal models leading to the design of a therapeutic hypothesis to be tested in a clinical trial., The clinical de- velopment of Seribantumab an ERBB3-targeting agent, followed this path for the bench to the clinic [ 136]., Preclinical prediction of sensitive phenotypes using systems biology would serve for patient selection inhistology-based (umbrella) and aberration-based (basket) biomarker- driven clinical trials, both at enrollment and dynamically with se- quential testing., 5.3. Complementary approach using network science5.3.1. Pre-clinical studies supporting a network science approach The importance of having an overall context of the disease for pa- tient management, beyond the mere importance of genomic drivers is illustrated by the finding of non-mutational drivers of resistance [ 137], thefinding that synonymous mutations frequently act as driver muta- tions in human cancer [ 138] and that pseudogenes may contribute together with more classical genomic drivers to the transcriptionallandscape of cells, its cellular di fferentiation and cancer progression [139]., Smith et al. demonstrate the non-oncogenic protein MITF-de- pendent drug-tolerance wherein inhibiting MITF sensitizes the tumor cells again to BRAF and NRAS-inhibition., The synonymous mutations defi ned as changing the nucleotide sequence but not the sequence of the protein, contained within mostly oncogenes and not tumor suppressor genes,  are not only tissue-depen- dent, but also alter exonic motifs that regulate splicing., Also pseudo- genes are identi fied in several tumor types and lineages increasing proliferation and migration in in vitro assays., There is also an emerging importance of the non-coding cancer genome wherein alterations in non-coding enhancers a ffect gene-expression in several tumor types [140]., Furthermore the Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network per- formed an extensive molecular pro filing of lung adenocarcinoma using mRNA, microRNA,  DNA-sequencing integrated with copy number, methylation and proteomic analysis., Of interest MAPK and PI3K- pathway activation could only be attributed to known mutations in a fraction of cases, suggesting that additional pathways of activation,  despite the tremendous e ffort done so far, still need to be found [ 141]., The integration of genomic tools and integration with clinical variables was also assessed in a study by Yuan and colleagues [ 142]., Herein it was evident that the clinical variables as well as the genomic variables had limited added value when combined together, expect for a limited number of tumor-types, illustrating the redundancy of clini- cally useful information that genomics and clinics provide., All the above illustrates that although a reductionistic linear ap- proach has had some success bene fiting patients, the limits of it maysoon be reached., A network-based approach may thus be able to capture the in- formation of the information-system of the patient s tumor better and in a more complete manner than either approach alone., Adequately va- lidated network science assay will also be able to incorporate di fferent types of molecular and morphological data into a patient's individualnetwork, optimizing the use of current high throughput technologies like whole genome sequencing, RNA-sequencing,  etc, and morpholo- gical features like amount of tumor in filtrating lymphocytes whereas today these are rarely included in genomic clinical trial designs.Combining data from di fferent sources has been exempli fied in a study of prostate cancer combining a set of 232 SNP s, 6 plasma protein biomarkers and 5 standard clinical variables, demonstrating improved performance compared with PSA alone for the detection of tumors with a Gleason-score of at least 7 [ 143], illustrating that an integrated ap- proach may improve the assessed variable (screening, prediction, prognosis,  etc.), compared with a reductionistic approach. 5.3.2. A patient-centered approach A major advantage of network-based approaches is that they en- courage patient-centered approaches., Pemovska and colleagues have developed an Individual Systems Strategy based on a systematic ex vivo drug sensitivity and resistance testing and extensive molecular pro filing of the malignant cells in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) [144]., A complementary method would be to use a network science approach not only for drug discovery by itself but also for elucidatingwhether combinational administration of cancer drugs is superior to a combinational approach., Lee and colleagues have demonstrated using high density time-dependent measurements of signalling networks, gene expression pro files and cell phenotypic responses in combination with mathematical modelling, that the identi fication of rewired apop- totic pathways involving caspase-8 may render tumor cells more che-mosensitive with sequential treatment having more e ffect than a com- binational treatment [ 145]., The importance of elucidating the mechanisms of resistance through data-driven network modelling has been exempli fied in an additional study demonstrating that in melanoma cells NRAS has both growth promoting and survival properties, whereafter inhibition of NRAS with MAP-ERK inhibition only blocked the survival property, but not the proliferative property, explaining the appearance of resistance to this particular treatment., In this reasoning combining anti-survival with anti-proliferative drugs may thus be bene ficial [ 146]., These examples are illustrative of the added value of using data- driven modelling approaches reviewed in [ 147]., As such we conclude that reductionist approaches may be complemented by networkbiology. 5.3.3. An example of potential clinical application The treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer is one setting that can exemplify the concepts developed above., This might appear counter- intuitive as drug development in this setting has been very successful both for metastatic [ 148] and early disease [ 149, 150, 151 ]., Metastatic and relapsing patients are however not cured and new drug develop-ment in this setting continued successfully based on the presence of one sole predictive biomarker, HER2 overexpression/ampli fication,  with the regulatory approvals of lapatinib [ 152], pertuzumab [ 153] and T- DM1 [ 154]., Ongoing phase 3 clinical trials are continuing on the same model both in the adjuvant setting with pertuzumab (NCT02132949) and the metastatic setting with neratinib (NCT01808573)., However molecu-larly characterized HER2-positive breast cancer is not homogeneous and one example is the di fference in response to neoadjuvant che- motherapy combined with anti-HER2 agents between ER+/HER2+early breast cancer and ER-/HER2+ early breast cancer with a sig- nificantly higher rate of pathological complete response in ER-/HER2+ tumors., Furthermore, a subgroup of patients with HER2+ early breastV.S.K.

All rights reserved. cancer achieve a pathological response with chemotherapy-free double HER2-blockade hinting towards a di fference in biology [ 155, 156 ]., Indeed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) as well as gene-expres- sion pro filing (GEP) followed by intrinsic subtype classi fication were performed on a cohort of 64 HER2+ breast tumors and HER2 ampli-fication was considered by the authors to be a genomic alteration common to a group of tumors in the basal to luminal spectrum and notas a determinant of a unique subtype of breast cancer [ 157]., The dif- ference in response to anti-HER2 agents based on co-occurring somaticgenomic alterations has been described in biomarker analyses of the pivotal phase 3 clinical trials proving than more than a single bio- marker might be necessary [ 158]., On the other hand data on the predictive and/or prognostic value of germline cancer-predisposingmutations is scarce or nonexistent in the setting of HER2+ breast cancer., Indeed, 3% of patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline muta- tions develop HER2+ breast cancer [ 159]. These patients have been so far excluded for clinical trials testing PARP inhibitors. Beyond BRCA other germline cancer-predisposing mutations are associated with HER2+ breast cancer such as TP53 mutations [ 160, 161 ] and warrant investigation as contextual variables to guide treatments for HER2+breast cancer., While some anti-HER2 agents target the extracellular domain of HER2 and small molecules target the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, transcription and expression of the genome data play a predictive role for treatment e fficacy and emerging techniques are quanti fication of HER2 mRNA [ 162] and HER2 protein [ 163]., The integration of metabolic imaging such as zirconium-89-trastu- zumab labelling has served as a prospective method for mapping theheterogeneous expression of the target and predicting response to HER2-targeting agents [ 164]., Finally in this era of immunotherapy revival, the stroma and tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are being extensively studied and the correlation between lymphocytic in filtration and recurrence has been demonstrated in the adjuvant setting [ 165]., In the metastatic setting TIL infiltration was found to be correlated to improved survival in the CLEOPATRA trial [ 166], providing the rationale for therapies that boost the patient s immune system., Synergism between anti-HER2 agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors has been demonstrated preclinically[167] and clinical trials are currently ongoing with the combination of trastuzumab and pembrolizumab (NCT02129556) and the combinationof T-DM1 and atezolizumab (NCT02924883)., 5.4. Clinical network assay recommendations The use of a network-science approach may be particularly useful to capture the linear and nonlinear aspects of cancer biology, and be as such relevant for drug development and the development of predictive assays., If these types of approaches are introduced into the clinics fortreating patients a rigorous analytical and clinical validity followed bya trial design aimed at determining clinical utility is imperative., The Institute of Medicine recently provided recommendations ran- ging from clinical utility to regulatory issues [ 168] on OMICS based approaches., A clinical trial protocol need not be static and should beadaptable to be able to incorporate new emerging knowledge., It is evident that the development of a complex signature in this context thus a signature derived from a network-based assay including genomic and non-genomic sources need to follow the same rigorous process before considering its use in a clinical trial setting aimed at in fluencing the treatment of patients with cancer., Lisa McShane and colleagueshave developed a list of 30 criteria for omics-based assays ranging from sample handling and requisites hereof, performance evaluation of theassay, the clinical trial designs ending with regulatory and legal criteria., All these elements should be addressed to determine the applic- ability of any omics-based assay [ 169]., It may be assumed that a net- work-based assays are similar in nature to an omics-based approach thus it is evident that the criteria developed by McShane and colleagues apply in a similar manner to network science approaches., In a com- plementary approach FDA has recently issued a perspective on the regulatory implications of complex signatures to predict response to targeted therapies, ranging from regulations applicable to in vitro di- agnostic devices to companion tests [ 170]., Challenging aspects of assay performance validation include ana- lytical issues like cut-off issues precision,  reproducibility and replic- ability,  robustness,  limit of detection,  etc., The development of a net- work-based assay for clinical use raises tremendous challenges and if not addressed adequately with statistically powered designs and patient sizes, rigorous analytical and clinical validity, the classi fication of the patient may be dubious [ 171, 172 ]., Michiels and colleagues have recently proposed a set of evidence- based criteria for prognostic signatures from laboratory to clinicalpractice, ranging from proof of concept,  followed by analytical and clinical validity, with subsequent demonstration that the signature addsinformation to existing clinico-pathological information, has impact on clinical decision making and is cost-e ffective at the end [ 173]., Integrating networks in the design of adaptive trials hold the pro- mise of linking drug activity to a baseline cancer context and could guide the design of combinatorial strategies to overcome both intrinsic and acquired drug resistance., Table 1 presents the advantages of using an network based approach compared to an OMICS based method in aclinical trial setting., In the next section we propose a preclinical trial concept with a patient-centered clinical trial model including spatial genomics with immunogenomics, single or bulk molecular pro filing,  clonal and mor- phological heterogeneity., Considering the novelty and unprecedentednature of this approach we follow the recommendations of Mogil and MacLeod to balance the demand for scienti fic novelty with the need for rigorous quality while preparing for a seamless transition between Table 1 Differences between OMICS based and Network Science based approaches to clinical trial design., OMICS based trials Network based trials Comments Individual genes, a.k.a. gene signature [ 131] [132] Interactions between genes Networks can encompass all the possible interactions of predictive features, providing more insight into patient-speci fic biology [ 174], [175] Prediction of drug responsiveness (NCT02132949, NCT01808573)The complex biological relationships induced by the drug can be capturedthrough networksOMICS based models assume that genes are independent entities andrespond to treatments independently., But drugs will also a ffect other genes and pathways, which could potentially play a role on de fining the responsiveness of a drug to a patient [ 90] Complex interpretation of the disease etiology [ 130] Facilitate interpretation of the disease etiologyMultivariate models are complex to interpret compared to networkbased methods., The process of inference of a disease and related it tothe value of the response variable is non trivial [ 176]., Interactions among variables are easy to interpret in networks Integration of heterogeneous data types is challenging and prone to possible inconsistent conclusions due to noisein each data type [ 130]Networks are more robust to noise anddata type heterogeneitySimilarity Fusion Network (SNF) is a powerful network basedapproach that integrates various data types representing a completelandscape of the disease [ 177]V.S.K., Manem et

However, our main goal remains to test the innovative approach presented here [178]. 6. An example of integration of networks in clinical trial design A schematic diagram of a randomized clinical trial design im- plemented with three treatment regimens, namely,  treatment withtrastuzumab,  lapatinib, and a combination treatment with both the drugs is displayed in Fig., 5. We assume here that molecular pro filing data of all those patients who have responded and non-responded totrastuzumab, lapatinib,  and a combination of both are available from earlier studies., In general a network construction method utilizes all the samples from a cohort and builds the network, termed as the aggregate network., In simple words the aggregate network that represents the cohort can be viewed as a linear combination of networks from individual samples in the cohort., The following network methodology deconvolutes the aggregate network (constructed using N samples) of a given population into a group of individual, patient-speci fic networks., In particular this method addresses the problem associated with phenotypic hetero-geneity in the tumor samples in the cohort, and could potentially help the oncologists stratify patients according to their tumor biology., There are two key aspects to our proposed methodology in a clinical trial setting (i) construction of patient-speci fic network, (ii) treatment selection based on the patient-speci fic networks., These patient-speci fic networks can be explored retrospectively to re fine our biological un- derstanding of the tumor response in the context of gene interactions.Kuijjer et al., recently introduced LIONESS (Linear Interpolation to Obtain Network Estimates for Single Samples) a network constructionframework to infer patient-speci fic networks based on the tran- scriptomic pro filing of the tumors., This method provides an opportu- nity to investigate and explore therapeutic opportunities for individual patients [ 179]., 1. An aggregate network is constructed using all the samples from a given set of patients ( Fig. 6). Correlation and mutual information- based measures can be used to construct the aggregate network say with the mRNA expression pro files using all the samples in the co- hort., 2. We then extract individual patient networks that contribute to the aggregate network. LIONESS framework assumes that an aggregatenetwork that is constructed without the patient of interest representsa common network [ 179]., The di fference in this individual network with the aggregate network represents a perturbation to that net- work, e ffectively modelling the gene interactions speci fic to the patient tumor,  presented in Fig., 7. 3. Clustering is a method of grouping samples into clusters such that those within each cluster are closely related to each other than thosein other cluster., Once we obtain patient-speci fic networks from step 2 we perform a hierarchical clustering on each patient speci fic network., This helps us identify homogeneous groups of patients who are clustered together. This framework could potentially stratify the patients and assign them to a treatment regimen. Another main advantage of performing the hierarchical clustering is that one can obtain outliers (if any) within the cohort., One of the important as- pects of clustering is the distance metric that will be used to cluster patient-speci fic networks as a group., 4. There are several algorithms that are proposed in the literature to compare networks [ 180181, 182, 183, 184 ]., Also, several modes of network comparison has been discussed in [ 185]. These network comparison algorithms are promising tools to apply in this context and group a homogeneous set of patients to any treatment regimen., Comparison of two or more interaction networks can address the following key questions a) which gene-gene interactions and groups of interactions are likely to have equivalent functions across a group of patients, for example in responders?, b) Based on these simila- rities can we obtain novel insights into the functional information about these putative gene-gene interactions that are poorly char- acterized in non-responders?, c) What do these (groups of) interac- tions convey us about the biology of the (outlier) patient? InFig. 8 , Groups 1, 2 denote patients treated with Trastuzumab, Lapatinib. Clustering of all patients will result in two clusters, i.e. all patients treated with Trastuzumab will fall in one cluster and all pa- tients treated with Lapatinib will be in another cluster., If a patient does not cluster with any group then that patient is called as an outlier and further investigation needs to be carried out on that patient., This couldconvey the following to the oncologist a) the patient needs more genomic tests to investigate the biological or functional information which is di fferent from other patients, b) needs a di fferent treatment regimen,  for example,  a sequential treatment protocol., To summarize this methodology can also be used to assign a patient to a given treatment arm and at the same time identi fication of patients who might not respond to a given treatment regimen (even before admin-istration of the drug)., Fig. 5. An example of a clinical trial design where patients are randomly assigned to one of the three treatment arms, namely,  treatment with Trastuzumab,  Lapatinib, and a combination treat- ment with both the drugs., This randomization of patients can be replaced with network science ap- proaches by constructing patient specifi c networks.V.S.K., Manem et al.

Conclusions It is becoming evident that there are limits to personalized medicine as it is being practised today, generating high costs, and bene fiting relatively few patients in proportion to the number of patient samples that are being assayed., Despite the tremendous importance of the genomic revolution being developed by various institutions there is still a need to develop collaborative programs that recognise and handle the limitations seen today [ 186], as combined analysis of biomarkers at the DNA and transcriptomic level will probably be able to have moreclinical utility than either marker alone [ 187]., Since genomic alterations vary in their cooperation between cancer types [ 188] since single cell analysis may reveal that mutations found at a population level may not be re flected at an individual level [ 189], since di fferent models of clonal evolution exist within and between tumors [ 190],  [ 191], since it is becoming evident that drugs working in the metastatic setting not necessarily translate to the same bene fits in the adjuvant setting, suggesting a di fferent biology in both settings, since combining molecular targeted agents of highly e ffective single- agents is not necessarily better than either alone [ 192, 193 ], it is evident that a reductionist approach will ultimately not enable integration ofthe existing morphological features and molecular data obtained with high-throughput technologies at the bulk and/or single cell level., Ultimately this necessitates new models of data-analysis and in- corporation of these models into new clinical trial designs with an ap- propriate data sharing policy [ 194]., As has been seen in complex trait analysis the combined use of network science and reductionisticapproaches will probably better capture the linear and nonlinear as- pects of cancer biology [ 195]., A network science approach in cancer biology has been demon- strated to capture relevant targets that could not have been found with a reductionistic approach [ 196, 197 ]., A network science approach is needed that will be able to integrate all relevant variables needed for aparticular purpose, exempli fied by the development of genome-scale model for drug target and biomarker identi fication [198, 199, 200, 201, 188, 202 ]., It is imperative that the detection of multi-parametric biomarkers through network science approaches follows the same rigor in the de- velopment path of any biomarker and assay [ 203, 168 ] if they are to be included in a clinical trial context aimed at treating patients., Only by applying rigorous patient-centered standards at all levels of knowledge of cancer biology in the process of validation of biomarkers and in the consequent validation and implementation of new assays within a clinical trial and ultimately in a healthcare setting will we able to meet the promise of Precision Medicine at the individual patient level [ 204, 205, 206, 207 ]., Acknowledgements VSKM was supported by the Cancer Research Society (Canada).

      "question": "What is the main objective of the research in this paper?",
      "answer": "The main objective of the research in this paper is to develop and advocate for a network science approach in clinical trials to enhance cancer care. The authors aim to illustrate how integrating network science and systems biology principles can improve the understanding of cancer as a complex disease, facilitate the identification of potential biomarkers, and inform therapeutic decisions. They emphasize the need for a new generation of clinical trial designs that incorporate these advanced methodologies to advance precision medicine and address the challenges associated with high-throughput molecular diagnostic tools in oncology."

    {
      "question": "Can you summarize the abstract of the paper?",
      "answer": "The abstract of the paper discusses the integration of network science into clinical trials for cancer treatment, emphasizing a patient-centered approach. It highlights the challenges faced in incorporating advanced molecular diagnostic tools into clinical oncology, particularly due to the complexity of high-throughput data generated from omics technologies (DNA, RNA, and protein profiling). The authors argue that traditional linear modeling methods may limit our understanding of cancer's complexity and propose that network science and systems biology, utilizing machine learning and multi-source data integration, can reveal intricate biological changes. This approach aims to enhance therapeutic decision-making and advance precision medicine, necessitating the development of innovative clinical trial designs. The review outlines the challenges posed by high-throughput technologies and proposes a framework for implementing network science in clinical trials to improve cancer care."
