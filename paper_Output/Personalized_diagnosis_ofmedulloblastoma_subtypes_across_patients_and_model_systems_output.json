Introduction Medulloblastoma (MB) subtype strati fication has evolved with the increased availability of genomic data and improved understanding of MB inter-tumor heterogeneity, signalling pathways,  and molecular pathogenesis mechanisms [15]., Four MB subtypes, referred to as the WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4, are recognized. These differ based on histopathology, epidemiology, prognosis, and genomic pro files[4, 5]. Of these Group 3 and Group 4 exhibit poor prognosis and are poorly characterized at the molecular level, thus presenting ongoing clinical challenges [17]., Ongoing studies to determine subtype-speci ficb i o l o g - ical mechanisms currently involve extensive gene expression pro filing and sequencing of MB subtypes, to detect recurrent mutations,  novel SNVs,  CNAs,  and CpG methylation sites [79]., These efforts were instru- mental to improving MB subtype classi fication but relied on large data sets, a requirement not easily attainable in future classi fication studieswhere limited sample sizes are available., This concern instigated devel- opment of several MB prediction assays in a clinical setting [410, 11] ., These include identi fication of a set of 22 subtype-speci fic signature genes using nanoString nCounter technology to measure mRNA expres- sion from FFPE [11], as well as development of a 13-gene multiplex mRNA expression signature speci fic for the WNT and SHH subtypes [10]., Unfortunately these signatures have not been further developed into automated classi fiers for use by researchers and clinicians., To use these signatures new MB samples would need to be interrogated by hi- erarchical cluster analysis or other orthogonal methods, which requires additional external samples to generate comparisons., Accordingly the proposed classi fication practices have provided a systems-wide view of subtype tumorigenesis, but remain de ficient in providing individual- ized predictions of particular MB samples., The need for personalized predictors of MB samples is not only nec- essary for prediction of patient samples, but also for predictions of sam- ples pertaining to model systems., These latter predictions are important for future research that utilizes MB cell lines and mouse models to study MB subtype disease origins and signaling pathways [12]., Applicability of current classi fication schemes towards model predictions is unclear es- pecially as the reference gold standard to compare model systems to human subtypes remains highly ambiguous., The developed Agreement of Differential Expression (AGDEX) algorithm attempted to address this problem by comparing expression of orthologous genes to determine transcriptomic similarities between tissues from different experiments [13 15]., However AGDEX relies on ap r i o r i assumptions regardingGenomics 106 (2015) 96 106 Abbreviations, MB,  medulloblastoma,  MM2S,  Medullo-Model To Subtype,  MH2H,  medullo-human to human,  MM2H, medullo-mouse to human,  IHC,  immunohistochemis- try,  FFPE,  formalin- fixed paraf fin embedded, GTML, Glt1-tTA (glutamate transporter 1- tetracycline transactivator) and tetracycline response element (TRE)-MYCN/luciferase(Luc) mouse medulloblastoma, MCC,  Matthews correlation coef ficient,  GEO,  Gene Expression Omnibus,  KNN,  k-nearest neighbor, PCA,  principal component analysis., Corresponding authors at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre,  University Health Network,  Toronto, Ontario,  Canada., E-mail addresses: deena.gendoo@utoronto.ca (D.M.A. Gendoo), bhaibeka@uhnresearch.ca (B.

Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Genomics journal homepage www.elsevier.com/locate/ygeno which samples can be compared in s ubtype differential expression analyses, which introduces user bias and ultimately prevents robust classi fication of single tumor samples., Additionally the algorithm also necessitates a user-selected reference model, perhaps human or mouse normal cerebellum,  to generate differential analysis com- parisons., Any ap r i o r i assumptions of reference samples may yield imprecise comparisons with the tested data sets and is doubly prob-lematic when matched reference samples to the tested data are unavailable., Collectively current classi fication methods remain impractical for both research and clinical settings, where reference samples are unat- tainable,  or limited samples or tumor materials are available., They fail to address the critical requirement of generating personalized single- sample predictions for both MB patients and samples pertaining to model systems., To address this focal and much-needed research di- rection in MB we developed a novel, Medullo-Model To Subtype (MM2S) classi fier that matches individual MB samples against human medulloblastoma subtypes., To the best of our knowledge MM2S isthefirstsingle-sample classi fier of MB samples, which does not rely on a reference sample or multiple sample replicates to generate predic- tions., We developed a systems-based methodology that facilitates ap- plication of the MM2S algorithm to MB subtype prediction of both patient samples and model systems, including cell lines and mouse models., We demonstrate the ef ficacy and versatility of MM2S via the largest MB strati fication analysis of 23 publicly gene expression data sets, spanning 754 patients,  26 cell lines,  and 261 mouse samples., We discuss the implications of MM2S towards narrowing the gap between MB subtype classi fication methods and the development of singular, subtype-speci fic diagnosis of patients,  cell lines,  and mouse models., 2. Results 2.1.

To tune the hyperparameters of the MM2S classi fier we performed multiple 10-fold cross-validation on the training set,  repeated 100 times., We ob- served that the best model was obtained by selecting the k= 5 nearest neighbors in a genomic space de fined by 104 unique gene sets [S1, Table S1(A)], which were used to generate a ranked matrix of pathway activity scores (see Methods)., In this setting the classi fier was able to correctly classify human samples with high levels of accuracy for nor- mal cerebellum (100%) and well-studied MB groups such as SHH (100%) and WNT (100%), as well as the less characterized Group 4 (97.6%) and Group 3 (66.6%) subtypes [S2,  Table S2]., Despite the imbal- ance of the subtypes in this training data set with Group 4 constituting the largest group and WNT samples constituting the smallest, we did not observe strong biases toward Group 4 subtype class predictions., 2.2. MM2S prediction of MB subtypes on human samples We tested MM2S prediction effectiveness on independent human samples generated on a variety of microarray platforms, spanning407 MB samples across four separate data sets [ Fig., 2 A, S3: Table S3(A E), S4: Table S4(A D)]. Despite the difference in subtype sample sizes across these data sets MM2S predictions remain robust for the well-studied WNT and SHH subtypes, as well as normal cere- bellum,  exhibiting 96 100% accuracy across the data sets [ Fig., 2 B]. All the samples pertaining to WNT group and normal cerebellum in the respective data sets predict correctly [ Fig., 2 A], despite that these groups represents the smallest groups within the MM2S train- ing set. Group 3 and Group 4 prediction accuracy ranges between 74% and 87% for most data sets. A substantial proportion of Group 3 samples are misclassi fied as Group 4 which may re flect upon weak molecular characterization of these subtypes [ Fig., 2 A]. However we observed that the prognostic value of our classi fier is statistically similar to the published classi fication of MB samples across these groups [ Fig., 3 ], thereby underscoring the validity of the subtypes. Ac- cordingly the observed concordance between original and MM2S classi fications supports the biomedical relevance of the classi fier., The combined MM2S prediction accuracy for each subtype is report- ed in Table S3(E). We also applied our classi fier to the limited num- ber of human MB cell lines publicl y available [S4, Table S4(O)] and note that the majority of cell line predictions belong to either WNT or SHH, but not Group 3 or Group 4., SHH Group 3 Group 4 WNT NormalNumber of Samples Accuracy (%)A B 2040608010001020304050607080Normal WNT SHH Group4 Group3 Fig., 2.

MM2S prediction of MB subtypes on mouse samples To demonstrate MM2S flexibility and applicability for cross-species prediction of MB subtypes, we used our algorithm in a meta-analysis of 261 murine samples across 10 data sets to classify the mouse MB modelsinto their human counterparts [ Table 1 , S4,  Table S4(E N)]., For each data set calculations were based on a ranked matrix of activity scores of unique and subtype-discriminative gene sets [S1, Table S1(F Q)] be- tween the human and mouse data sets., MM2S facilitate subtype predictions across for single mouse sam- ples as well as establishing a consensus prediction across replicates of a mouse models., Our tested data set spans at least 20 mouse models [Table 1 ], in addition to normal cerebellum. We focus here on mouse models that are heavily used in in vivo MB studies and demonstrate overall MM2S predictions across all the replicates of these models [Fig., 4 ,Table 1 ]. MM2S demonstrates relative consistency of subtype predictions across replicates of well-studied mouse models., Ptch- mutated mouse models [16] (Ptch +/ Math1-creERT2, , Ptch1Fl/Fl,  Nestin-creERT2, , Ptch1Fl/Fl, P t c h 1+/Cdkn2C/),  which are experimentally associated with the SHH subtype, all predict as SHH across several data sets [ Fig., 4 ]. Consensus predictions of experimentally associated SHH mouse models such as SmoM2 (Math1-cre, SmoM2Fl/+,  hGFAP-cre, , SmoM2Fl/+)[16]also predict by MM2S as belonging to SHH subtype [ Fig., 4 ]. We compared how our MM2S algorithm compares against existing subtype classi fications algorithms including the agree- ment of differential expression (AGDEX) analysis for each of mouse models., There is a strong concordance between MM2S and AGDEX across murine models that are predicted as SHH as well as the Group 3 GTML model [ Fig., 4 ]. Distinctively the presence of a normal subtype, and the subsequent prediction of normal cerebellum samples, is a new addition in MM2S that is unavailable in AGDEX., More than 80% of the normal cerebellum samples tested MM2S correctly predict as normal with the exception of a small number of samples that predict as SHH., These tumor-like samples may re flect upon sample heterogeneity and/or technical variation (e.g. experimental processing) in the samples that distinguishes them from true normal mousecerebellum., Interestingly all of the mispredicting samples were bio- logical replicates of normal P7 cerebellum and pertained to the same data set (GSE36594)., The ability of MM2S to conduct singular sample predictions facili- tates further investigation into tumor heterogeneity and the exploration of potential intermediate phenotypes., The simplicity of our approach facilitates the identi fication of the first- and second-choice human sub- types for each sample replicate of a particular mouse model [ Fig., 5 A]. This is in stark contrast to AGDEX where a summarized AGDEX scoreis produced across all replicates of the model., Using our personalized prediction scores we investigated the distribution of subtype predic- tions across all replicates of the GTML mouse model (Glt1-tTA (gluta- mate transporter 1-tetracycline transactivator) and tetracycline response element (TRE)-MYCN/luciferase (Luc) mouse medulloblasto- ma) [ Fig., 5 B]. This was the only mouse model for which we have observed Group 3 predictions across a large number of sample repli- cates, suggesting the potential for a non-SHH mouse model., There are 32 sample replicates for this model 20 of which predict as Group 3, many with high degree of con fidence ( N80%) [ Fig., 5 B]. Based on these predictions the GTML mouse model shown can be con fidently labeled by a majority consensus as a Group 3 medulloblastoma model., However there are a number of samples that predict as SHH and a small subset of normal-like tumor samples [ Fig., 4, Fig. 5 B] suggesting that further investigation would need to be con- ducted on these heterogeneous samples to assess their validity for use as a Group 3 mouse model., The use of single-sample classi fications opens a new research avenue into potential intermediate phenotypes., We investigated sample predic- tions of the WNT-associated Blbp-cre, Ctnnb1(ex3) Fl/+Trp53Fl/Flmouse model, which produced con flicting predictions with MM2S compared to AGDEX [ Fig., 4, Fig. 5 C]. Using MM2S, half of the samples predict as WNT and other half as SHH. The con flicting predictions we have observed may re flect upon a heterogeneous intermediate, murine model., Previ- ous classi fication of this model using AGDEX indicated that the second-highest and signi ficantly predicting group for this model, follow- ing WNT,  is SHH [15]., Whether this model represents a heterogeneousAB Published MB Subtypes MM2S MB Subtype Predictions0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Probability of overall survival Group3 Group4SHHWNT P = 8.9E 03 012345 Time (years) No., At Risk Group3 45 39 30 21 14 12 Group4 86 81 74 59 41 27 SHH 45 42 39 33 24 16 WNT 19 19 14 10 9 7 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0Probability of overall survival Group3 Group4SHHWNT P = 5.9E 04 012345 Time (years) No., At Risk Group3 50 45 34 23 13 12 Group4 82 77 72 58 42 27 SHH 43 39 36 31 23 15 W N T 2 02 01 51 11 0 8 Fig., 3.

The MM2S server The generation of subtype-speci fic predictions of medulloblastoma samples is a challenging process that requires substantial computationand data processing to generate predictions., We introduce here the first free, automated, and publicly available web service called MM2S. This service is available at bopennet-33-129.uhnres.utoronto.ca/ mm2s/mm2s.html Nand only requires normalized gene expression pro- files for samples of interest as input., Results that are generated for each of the samples include the final MM2S prediction as well as the neigh- boring subtype predictions for each sample., We thus provide the userwith predictions of the highest ranking and second-highest subtypes that can be attributed to any particular sample [ Fig., 5 ]. This aids in the interpretability of the results for diagnostic characterization of MB samples. 3. Discussion The development of a flexible subtype classi fication method for MB is a great challenge and poses an obstacle for strati fication of MB pa- tients and model systems., We have developed MM2S the first single- sample, medulloblastoma-speci fic classi fier that allows for the easy classi fication of human MB patient samples and model systems to their corresponding human medulloblastoma subtypes., Using our MM2S classi fier we conducted the largest meta-analysis of human patients,  cell lines, and mouse MB gene expression data from variable microarray platforms and different sources of origin., We have demon- strated the versatility and robustness of MM2S towards prediction of MB samples across these diverse data sets and MB samples., Our classi- fier demonstrates statistically signi ficant and similar prognostic value to the current classi fication of MB human patient tumors, which sup- ports the validity of our predictions., Our MM2S classi fier demonstrates signi ficant novelty over other MB classi fication schemes by providing personalized predictions, without requiring a reference sample (e.g.,  human cerebellum), or multiple rep- licates per sample to generate subtype comparisons., This asset makes MM2S versatile for diagnostic classi fication of patients in basic research and preclinical settings, as well strati fication of MB samples that have been generated on different platforms and different model systems.Another innovative feature of MM2S is that normal state is considered as a subtype within our classi fier., This may serve to identify normal- like tumor samples or conversely, normal reference samples that mispredict as tumor subtypes., Such cases may represent instances of human error (mislabeling of samples) technical error (contaminationwithin samples), or even biological variation (undifferentiated and early stage tumor samples)., With the ability to identify con fidence thresholds for each sample ambiguous samples can now be discarded or further explored., Undoubtedly this promises to help minimize assumptions that are made during the classi fication process, and subse- quently aid in accurate assessment of MB samples and their subsequent management., The above-mentioned features introduced within MM2S are signi fi- cant additions that have not been observed in previous classi fication schemes., We have compared our findings against AGDEX which is to date the only classi fication method that promoted cross-species predic- tions of MB samples., MM2S flexibility of predicting mouse models su- persedes the AGDEX classi fication method where one must combine potential replicates into a particular subtype to conduct differential ex- pression analysis against a reference set of samples., To properly conduct such an analysis this assumes (i) the existence of a reference genotype such as normal human cerebellum and (ii) the correct assignment of samples to a particular group for transcriptomic comparison against the reference genotype., These requirements have been alleviated under MM2S which reduces potential sources of bias as well as ambigu- ity in interpretation of the results., T h eM

subtypes, including SHH and WNT., Despite Group 3 and Group 4 being less characterized at the molecular level MM2S still succeeds in generating accurate predictions with high degrees of accuracy for Grou p 4 (83.2%) and Group 3 (78.2%), with similar prognostic value to current MB subtype classi fications of these samples [ Fig., 2, Fig. 3 , Table S3(E)]. The decrease in accuracy of our Group 3 and Group 4 predictions compared to SHH and WNT, may re flect upon the molecular complexity of these subtypes., Nota- bly we have demonstrated that the MM2S algorithm can also beextended towards MB predictions of gene expression pro files de- rived from cell line data sets in addition to primary tumors and mouse models., The MM2S systems-based algorithm is flexible for use towards cross- species prediction of MB subtypes, such as molecular characterization of MB mouse models., We have demonstrated that MM2S predicts the same human counterparts for several well-studied mouse MB models that were experimentally designed to be associated with a particular human subtype [ Fig., 4 ,Table 1 ].

Despite vast differences in our ap- proach our findings also corroborate with AGDEX for the well-studied mouse models., Our MM2S investigations on mouse models indicate the potential for future development of non-SHH mouse models., Given the dif ficulty in identi fication of non-SHH models [16] this will be a welcome devel- opment and a signi ficant advancement for MB research in this area., We have identi fied a clear example of a Group 3 mouse model (GTML) as well as the existence of a potentially heterogeneous mouse model (Blbp-cre, , Ctnnb1(ex3)Fl/+Trp53Fl/Fl)., We have highlighted that while our findings are largely corroborated with AGDEX, MM2S super- sedes AGDEX by further identifying the exact samples that have driven the overall prediction of these mouse models., In the case of the GTML mouse model for example MB scientists can now focus on the subset of replicates which exhibit high con fidence as Group 3 when conducting future research using these samples., Our personalized approach will beinstrumental for future MB research that relies on mouse models to un- derstand MB subtype-speci fic pathogenesis in vitro ., Our study has several potential limitations. First while MM2S suc- ceeds in generating single-sample,  individual classi fications, it is impor- tant to acknowledge that early pre-processing of these samples prior to classi fication is not necessarily conducted at the single-sample level., One may argue that a single-sample GSEA in which the absolute ex- pression of the genes is compared, requires an input of a single- sample normalized gene expression values using standard algorithms such as frozen RMA or MAS5.0, instead of RMA., The MAS5 algorithm is no longer applicable to human or mouse gene ST platforms and fRMA implementation for the Gene 1.1 ST platforms,  which were used in this analysis, is currently lacking., Thus we opted to use the RMA algo- rithm, which was applicable across the different microarray platforms of this study, including our human training set., Second, we restricted our analysis to the well-established molecular MB subtypes.

Human expression array processing and data analysis Human expression pro files were obtained from a set of 754 nor- mal and tumor medulloblastoma samples previously published across 7 separate studies, whi ch were generated on 4 different low- and high-density microarray platforms [ Fig., 6 A, B]. The training set for MM2S classi fication encompassed 347 samples from three studies deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE37382, GSE30074,  GSE41842,  Fig., 6 A). These studies were generated using the high-density Gene 1.1 and 1.0 ST arrays recently developed to supersede standard 3 based microarray platforms [ Fig., 6 A]. The training set encompass all four MB subtypes (SHH WNT,  Group 3,  a n dG r o u p4 ) , a sw e l la ss a m p l es obtained from normal human cerebellum.A B C DDataset Platform Medulloblastoma Subgroups Normal Human CerebellumSamples SHH WNT Group3 Group4 GSE37382 P1 51 - 46 188 13 298 GSE30074 P2 9 2 6 13 - 30 GSE41842 P2 3 6 2 8 - 19 Dataset Platform Medulloblastoma Subgroups Normal Human CerebellumSamples SHH WNT Group3 Group4 GSE37418 P3 10 8 16 39 - 73* GSE49243 P3 73 - - - - 73 GSE10327 P3 15 9 11 27 - 62 CHO P4 52 14 51 71 11 199 Dataset Platform Samples GSE22875 P3 6 GSE7578 P3 3 GSE43552 P3 3 GSE36133 P4 4 E-MTAB-783 P10 6 Cancer Cell Line Encylopedia (CCLE)P11 4 Dataset Platform Samples GSE36594 P5 56 GSE24628 P6 16 GSE33199 P6 64 GSE11859 P6 27 GSE50824 P6 19 GSE19534 P6 26 GSE34126 P6 19 GSE2426 P7 14 GSE9299 P8, P9 10 GSE6463 P8, P9 10SHHWNTGroup 3 Group4Normal SHH WNT Group 3 Group4Normal Ptch1+/ Math1 creERT2, , Ptch1Fl/Fl Nestin creERT2, , Ptch1Fl/Fl Ptch1+/ Cdkn2C / Tlx3 cre, ,  SmoM2Fl/+ Olig2 tvacre, , SmoM2Fl/+ Math1 cre, , SmoM2Fl/+ hGFAP cre, , SmoM2Fl/+ Nestin cre, , Trp53Fl/Fl Cdkn2C / MycDNTrp53 (Prom1+ Lin stem cells) MycDNTrp53 (Prom1+ Lin+ progenitors)Cdkn2c /Trp53 /, mMyc Cdkn2c /Trp53 /, hMyc Cdkn2c /Trp53 /,  MycN Glt1 tTA, , TRE MYCN/Luc (GTML) Blbp cre, , Ctnnb1(ex3)Fl/+ Trp53Fl/Fl Normal CerebellumD283 MED D341 MED DAOY ONS 76 PFSK 1 D384 MEDD458 MEDD425 MED Fig., 6.

Human patient data sets used for MM2S training (I) and testing (II) s ets are shown along a summarized distribution of MB subtypes for each set., The original data set in GSE37418 (*) contains 76 samples but three samples have been excluded du e to their classi fication as SHH outliers, or unclassi fied (GSM918628,  GSM918618,  GSM918644)., We collected 26 cell line samples representing 8 common MB cell lines (III). Murine data sets and the correspon ding mouse models they represent are also indicated (IV). The gene expression platform and number of samples used for each data set is shown.

All data sets contain samples across the 4 MB sub- types except for GSE49243 that only contains SHH samples., The CHO data set is the only set containing normal cerebellum in addition to tumor samples. All the expression pro files for the testing set were gen- erated on the lower density Affymetrix microarray platforms as op- posed to Gene ST arrays., Each data set was processed separately within R/Bioconductor using theaffypackage. A modi fiedaffypackage (version 1.4.0) that could read different microarray platforms was downloaded from BrainArray [17]., CELfiles were read using the ReadAffy function and Affymetrix GeneChip probe level data was matched to EntrezGene ID using ENTREZG Custom CDFs (Version 18.0.0) downloaded from BrainArray [17].C E L files were analyzed using RMA background correction [18] and quantile normalization as part of the expresso function., Subtype classi fications for all samples for each of the GEO data sets were obtain- ed using the GEOquery package (version 2.30.1).Survival data pertaining MB patients were extracted for the CHO [3] and GSE37418 [3]data sets., Overall survival curves for both MM2S subtype predictions and original MB subtype classi fications were esti- mated using the Kaplan Meier estimator and compared using the two-sided log-rank test as implemented in the R/Bioconductor survcomp package [19], version 1.14.0,  the lower the estimate,  the bet- ter the prognostic value., 4.2.

Cell lines gene expression pro- files obtained from GEO and Array Express were processed similar to the above., For CCLE cell lines pro filed using the Illumina RNA-seq platform BAM files were obtained from CGHub ( https, //browser., cghub.ucsc.edu/ ) and processed using Cuf flinks (Version 2.2.1) [20] to obtain gene FPKM values. *MM2SHuman Datasets n=347 samples SHH Gr3,  Gr4, WNT MB subgroups + Normal Human Cerebellum RMA Normalization ssGSEA Gene Ontology Biological Process (GO BP) Genesets from BioMart Filter Genesets (20-100 genes per geneset) 963 Human genesets782 Mouse genesets 694 common genesets Optimize MM2H Hyperparameters (10 fold cross-validation) Generate ssGSEA-rank matrixSelect k Select number of discriminative genesets KNN SUBTYPE PREDICTIONSDiscriminative genesets per subtype = 24 k=5 Fig., 7. Overview of MM2S classi fier and study design. Overview of the analysis design of the MM2S classi fier which was trained on the 347 human samples across three data sets., MM2S design (depicted by the dotted blue box) accepts gene expression data as input and produces predictions of human subtypes, for each sample,  as output.104 D.M.A., Gendoo et al. / Genomics 106 (2015) 96 106 4.3. Mouse expression array processing and data analysis A total of 261 mouse expression pro files encompassing over 20 mouse models were selected for medulloblastoma subtype classi fica- tion [ Fig., 6 (D)]. These models were obtained from 10 data sets previous- ly deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus that were generated on 5 separate microarray platforms., All CEL files were processed similar to human patient tumor samples. 4.4. Development of the MM2S classi fier Human and mouse GMT files for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were generated by extracting gene sets of Gene Ontology Bio- logical Processes (GO BP) from the BioMart database using the R/ Bioconductor biomaRt package (version 2.18.0) [21, 22] , and selecting for the hsapiens_gene_ensembl and the mmusculus_gene_ensembl  under the Ensembl biomart repository., Gene sets generated for each species were filtered to include only those with gene set sizes between 20 and 100 genes., A total of 963 and 782 gene sets were generated for human and mouse, respectively. Of these 694 common gene sets between human and mouse were used to generate the final species- specificG M T files for input into the GSEA., A single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) [23] was conducted on mouse and human expression pro files using the R/ Bioconductor GSVA package (version 1.13.1) [24] to obtain single- sample, gene-set enrichment scores (ES)., Resultant gene sets were filtered to include gene set sizes containing between 20 and 100 genes. These gene sets were subsequently filtered to select the most dis- criminative set of subtype-speci fic gene sets (see next section)., The se- lected gene sets were then combined to generate a ranking matrix by ranking the gene sets in descending order of their ES scores for each sample, thus producing an ssGSEA-ranked matrix [ Fig., 7 ]. To enable robust classi fication of the samples into their human me- dulloblastoma counterparts we developed a k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classi fication model that uses the Manhattan distance [25] computed from the ssGSEA-rank matrices to make subtype predictions., The accu- racy of the classi fier was determined using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC [26]) on the human training set., Predictions were performed by majority voting of the knearest neighbors. For a given sample predictions with high con fidence ( 80% of votes, that is the pro- portion of neighbors of the most frequent subtype) are considered in- dicative of a human subtype, while predictions with b80% con fidence are considered to belong to an intermediate subtype., 4.5. Optimization of MM2S hyperparamaters To optimize our MM2S classi fie r t w op a r a m e t e r s , w h i c ha r et h e number of subtype-speci fic discriminative gene sets, and the num- ber of neighbors ( k),  must be tuned based on the training set [Fig., 7 ]. To do so we performed multiple 10-fold cross validations on the 347 human samples (training data set) to identify the number of neighbors, and the number and identity of discriminative gene sets that yield to the classi fier with the best MCC., The 10-fold cross validation was performed 100 times with varying random seeds for patients ordering., Below we describe how the 10-fold cross validation is conducted within a particular implementation run., Brie fly the KNN classi fier was trained on 90% ( n= 312 samples) of the training set and the remaining 10% ( n= 35 samples) were used for testing., This procedure was repeated 10 times with non-overlapping testing samples such that each sample is used as part of the testing set once and only once., At each fold of the cross-validation procedure the MCC score was calculat- ed for kranging from 1 to 25, and for varying number of gene sets per human MB subtype between 1 and 25., For each human MB subtype the gene sets were ranked based on the signi ficance of their ES to dis- criminate the given subtype over all the others combined (SHH vs.Group 3 + Group 4 + WNT + normal for instance), as estimated using the Wilcoxon rank sum test [27]., The selected gene sets were then combined to generate a ranking matrix for both human and mouse samples, by ranking the gene sets in descending order of their ES scores for each sample., The ssGSEA-ranked matrices were subse- quently used as input into the MM2S classi fier. The best kand gene set count used in MM2S were determined by selecting for the paired kand gene set count with the highest average MCC score across the 10 folds, across the 100 implementations of this procedure [S5,  Table S5 and S6,  Fig., S1]. 4.6. Application of MM2S onto human and mouse Cohorts MM2S has been developed by solely training on the human data set (n= 347 samples)., To generate robust predictions and taking into ac- count platform differences for each data set analyzed, we introduced an additional step within MM2S to select for gene sets that are common to human MB and the testing data set (whether human or mouse) be- fore generating ssGSEA-ranked matrices for predictions., For testing mouse data sets for example ssGSEA-ranked matrices are generatedfor gene sets that are common to human MB and mouse MB using human and mouse GMT files [Fig., 7 ]. For a given sample predictions with high con fidence ( 80%) are considered indicative of a correspond- ing human subtype, while predictions with b80% con fidence are consid- ered to belong to an intermediate subtype., Speci fically for mouse samples each sample can be unambiguously classi fied into its corre- sponding human subtype by obtaining a consensus prediction across all high con fidence predictions for all sample replicates of a particular model., Authors contributions DMAG and BHK conceived and designed the project.

      "answer": "The abstract of the paper discusses the development of a novel classifier called Medullo-Model To Subtype (MM2S) for the personalized diagnosis of medulloblastoma (MB) subtypes. Medulloblastoma is a heterogeneous malignant brain tumor that is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children. Traditional classification methods require large sample sizes and reference samples, which are often impractical in clinical settings.

      "question": "Are there any contradictions between this paper's findings and previous research?",
      "answer": "Based on the content of the paper, there are several points of potential contradiction between the findings of this study and previous research:\n\n1. **Reference Sample Dependency**: Previous classification methods for medulloblastoma (MB) subtypes often relied on large sample sizes and standard reference samples for subtype predictions. The paper highlights that these approaches are impractical in clinical settings with limited tumor biopsies. In contrast, the MM2S classifier developed in this study does not require reference samples or multiple replicates, which is a significant departure from traditional methods. This suggests that previous methods may not be as adaptable or applicable in real-world clinical scenarios as the authors propose with their new approach.\n\n2. **Accuracy of Subtype Predictions**: The MM2S classifier demonstrated high accuracy for well-characterized subtypes (WNT and SHH) but lower accuracy for the less-characterized Group 3 and Group 4 subtypes. The paper notes that Group 3 and Group 4 predictions ranged from 66.6% to 87%, which may reflect the weak molecular characterization of these subtypes. This contrasts with previous studies that may have reported higher accuracy or different prognostic values for these subtypes, indicating a potential discrepancy in the understanding of these less-characterized groups.\n\n3. **Cross-Species Predictions**: The MM2S classifier was able to classify mouse models into their human counterparts effectively, which is a novel feature not present in previous classification methods like AGDEX. The paper mentions that AGDEX relies on a priori assumptions regarding which samples can be compared, which introduces bias. The ability of MM2S to provide more accurate cross-species predictions may contradict previous findings that suggested limitations in accurately translating mouse model data to human subtypes.\n\n4. **Identification of Normal Samples**: The MM2S classifier includes the identification of normal cerebellum samples as a subtype, which is a new addition not typically addressed in previous classification schemes. This could challenge existing paradigms that do not consider normal-like tumor samples or misclassified normal samples, suggesting that prior research may have overlooked the complexity of sample classification.\n\n5. **Heterogeneity in Mouse Models**: The findings regarding the GTML mouse model, where MM2S predictions conflicted with AGDEX predictions, indicate that the MM2S classifier may reveal a level of heterogeneity in mouse models that previous methods did not capture. This could imply that earlier classifications may have oversimplified the complexity of these models.\n\nIn summary, the findings of this paper suggest that the MM2S classifier offers a more nuanced and adaptable approach to medulloblastoma subtype classification compared to previous methods, which may have limitations in accuracy, reference sample dependency, and the ability to account for sample heterogeneity."
