Penn1, 2,  and Benjamin Haibe-Kains1, 2, 3, 4 ABSTRACT  Identifying biomarkers predictive of cancer cell response to drug treatment constitutes one of the main challenges in precision oncology., Recent large-scale cancer pharmacogenomic studies have opened new avenues of research to develop predictive biomarkers by pro filing thousands of human cancer cell lines at the molecular level and screening them with hundreds of approved drugs and experimental chemical compounds., Many studies have leveraged these data to build predictive models of response using various statistical and machine learning methods., However a common pitfall to these methods is the lack of interpretability as to how they make predictions, hindering the clinical translation of these models., To alleviate this issue we used the recent logic modeling approach to develop a new machine learning pipeline that explores the space of bimodally expressed genes in multiple large in vitropharmacogenomic studies and builds multivariate, nonlinear,  yet interpretable logic-based models predictive of drug response., The performance of this approach was showcased in a compendium of the three largest in vitro pharmacogenomic datasets to build robust and interpretable models for 101 drugs that span 17 drug classes with high validation rates in independent datasets., These results along with in vivo and clinical validation support a better trans- lation of gene expression biomarkers between model systems using bimodal gene expression., Significance A new machine learning pipeline exploits the bimodality of gene expression to provide a reliable set of candidate predictive biomarkers wi th a high potential for clinical translatability., Introduction Identifying reliable predictive biomarkers of drug response is a key step in precision oncology., Large-scale cancer pharmacogenomic studies have boosted the research for finding predictive biomarkers by pro filing thousands of human cancer cell lines at the molecular level and screening them with hundreds of drugs (1 5)., Genomic features including gene mutations and copy-number variations (CNV), have been so far regarded as the state-of-the-art method for predicting patients response to drugs in the clinic., However it has been shown that most genomic biomarkers are found in small proportions of patients and within that subset, only a few have shown response to associated drugs (6)., Several studies have investigated alternative sources for predictive biomarkers of drug sensitivity in cancer pharmacogenomics (7, 8)., These studies have shown that gene expression outperforms other molecular features such as mutations and CNVs in predicting drug response in human cancer cell lines (7, 8)., Yet a major criticism of gene expression as a source of predictive biomarkers is the lack of repro- ducibility due to dependency on pro filing assays and batch effects., Toovercome such limitations several studies have focused their analyses on genes that have shown bimodal distribution of expression (9 11)., An advantage of a bimodal gene as a biomarker is that its modes can be used to robustly classify samples into two distinct expression states, allowing for easier interpretation,  reproducibility, and translation of the biomarker into the clinic., For example estrogen receptor (ESR1) bimodal expression de fines two biological states within patients with breast cancer., These states have been used to stratify breast cancer patients into the clinically relevant subtypes (ER /C6) and derive treat- ment decisions (12, 13)., Another example in cancer genomics is the use of 73 bimodal genes within ovarian cancer to de fine molecular sub- types with distinct survival rates (14)., We also have shown that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related genes were found to be bimodal pan-cancer and predictive of response to statin class of drugs (15)., Most pharmacogenomic studies that tackled the challenge of find- ing reliable predictive biomarkers for drug sensitivity employed univariate models for simplicity and interpretability (1, 2,  16)., How- ever such models do not account for dependencies between genes yielding suboptimal model predictions., Recent studies have applied more sophisticated machine learning techniques that capture depen- dencies between genes and produce more accurate biomarkers pre- dictive of drug sensitivity (7, 17)., However it becomes hard to biologically interpret these predicted biomarkers due to the complexity of these models and how they de fine the dependencies between the genes., In this study we developed a machine learning pipeline to explore the large space of bimodally expressed genes and build multivariate, nonlinear, yet interpretable logic-based models predic- tive of drug response in large in vitro pharmacogenomic studies (Fig., 1A ). Following our proposed approach we developed robust and interpretable models predictive of drug sensitivity for more than 100 drugs of different pharmacologic classes., Common models with two independent large test sets were validated and yielded high predictive rates (92% and 61% respectively).1Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network,  Toronto,  Ontario,  Canada.2Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto,  Toronto,  Ontario,  Canada.3Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto,  Toronto,  Ontario,  Canada.4Ontario Institute of Cancer Research,  Toronto, Ontario,  Canada., Note Supplementary data for this article are available at Cancer Research Online (http, //cancerres.aacrjournals.org/)., Corresponding Author Benjamin Haibe-Kains,  University Health Network,  101 College Street, Toronto,  Ontario M5G 1L7,  Canada., Phone 416-581-7628,  Fax,  416-581-8626,  E-mail, Benjamin.Haibe-Kains@uhnresearch.ca Cancer Res 2022, 82, 2378 87 doi, 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-21-2395 /C2112022 American Association for Cancer Research AACRJournals.org | 2378Downloaded from http, //aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/82/13/2378/3177355/2378.pdf by University Health Network user on 20 November 2023 Materials and Methods Datasets Data from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE, ref., 16), Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRPv2; refs. 5, 18), Genentech Cell Line Screening Initiative (gCSI, released in 2018; refs. 19, 20), Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC2, released in 2019; refs. 2, 3) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; ref. 21) were all processed using the same pipeline using the PharmacoGx R package pipeline (22 24). Gene expression pro files were generated using Kallisto pipeline (25) with GRCh38 as human reference., Patient-derived xenograft encyclopedia (PDXE) dataset (26) was downloaded and processed using Xeva R package (27)., Researchers can access HARTWIG Medical Foundation s (HMF) clinical and genomic data by applying for a data request at https, //www.hartwigmedicalfoundation.nl/applying-for-data., Bimodality of gene expression pro files Gene expression pro files obtained from CCLE dataset, were used to characterize the bimodality feature of each gene in the set by fitting its distribution into a mixture of two Gaussian distributions., For those genes with a good fit a bimodality score was calculated using the following formula, Bimodality score BI14ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi p/C31/C0pp /C3m1/C0m2 jjffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi n1n2 2q , where pis the proportion of samples in one group, m1andm2are the means of the expression level of the two modes,  and n1andn2are the variances., Similar characterization was done using the TCGA dataset. Genes then, were ranked according to their bimodality scores and the common protein-coding genes in the top 80th percentile of bimodality scores distribution in both CCLE and TCGA were chosen as top bimodal genes feature set., A binarization cutoff for each gene distin- guishing relatively low versus high expression was calculated by taking the average point between the modes of the two fitted Gaussian distributions., To assess the robustness of these bimodal genes and their ability to reproduce expression status (High/Low) in other datasets, we used the same cutoffs generated from CCLE data and applied them on the corresponding genes for the same cell lines in gCSI dataset that are in common with CCLE., We then compared that to binarizing the rest of the genes in the transcriptome using average expression as a cutoff to assess if bimodal genes have better reproducibility than using the rest of the genes in the transcriptome (Supplementary Fig., S1A). Aiming to determine if any bimodal gene is a surrogate of a tissue type we assessed the ability of each bimodal gene to predict each tissue type, where tissue types are hot-encoded,  i.e., a vector of a tissue type will have t h ev a l u eo f1f o rs a m p l e so ft h a tt i s s u et y p ea n d0f o rt h er e s t of the samples., Precision and F1 metrics were used to assess these predictions (Supplementary Fig. S6).

In previous studies we have shown that AAC,  in general, is a more consistent metric across datasets (29, 30) and a better metric for training drug sensitivity models using in vitro pharmacogenomic datasets (29)., We, therefore, selected the AAC metrics to train our set of logical models. LOBICO requires binarizing the effect of the drug and so we chose AAC of 0.2(30) as a threshold classifying samples to be either resistant (AAC <0.2) or sensitive (AAC >0.2) to each drug., However the continuous values of AACs are still used as weights to optimize the modeling step such that a higher penalty would be incurred if a highly sensitive sample was misclassi fied as resistant., Generated rules by LOBICO are described using the disjunctive normal form which is a standard notation to express logic functions., The disjunctive normal form is parameterized by two parameters K,  the number of disjuncts,  and M, the number of terms per disjunct., We varied KandMto represent models of different complexities i.e.,  from single predictors ( K141, M141) to more complex models [( K, M),  (1,  2) (1,  3) (1,  4) (2,  2) (2,  1) (3,  1) (4,  1)]., We used mRMRe to limit the search space of all possible logical combinations of features to the top ten highly relevant and complementary features to control the risk of overfitting and facilitate interpretation of the model., Supplementary Figure S9 shows that increasing the number of features increases the runtime of training the model., We then apply RLOBICO to find the best rule predicting sensitivity of samples to drugs. Finally to achieve more robust results, we create an ensemble rule based on a majority vote from rules generated by three different mRMRe feature sets followed by RLOBICO., All of these steps are performed in a 5-fold cross-validation setting to ensure no leak of information between folds., For evaluation of models we used a modi fied version of the concor- dance index (CI,  https, //github.com/bhklab/wCI,  ref., 31) in which we compare the concordance between measured AACs for a particular drug and the predictions of the associated model for the same samples., This modi fication accounts for noise in the drug screening assays as we found that repeating the same drug-cell line experiment in CTRPv2 resulted in inconsistencies in terms of measured drug response (AAC)., We further investigated this observation and found that 95% of the replicates of the same drug and cell line experiments showed differ- ences ( DAAC 14| AAC replicate1 - AAC replicate2 |) within 0.2 range (Supplementary Fig., S8). Hence we remove the pairs of AACs thathaveDAAC <0.2 from the calculation of the regular CI as they can flip directions within that range randomly., To avoid any information leak between the training and test sets we have considered fully indepen- dent datasets from our PharmacoDB database (22 24)., Research reproducibility CCLE CTRPv2,  gCSI, and GDSC2 can be downloaded using PharmacoGx R package (22)., Code to reproduce the results and figures is available at https //github.com/bhklab/Gene_Expression_Bimodality., We also provide a complete software environment through Code Ocean containing all necessary data and code to reproduce the analysis and figures described in this manuscript under the DOI https, //codeocean., com/capsule/8205812/tree/v1. RLOBICO R package was used to gen- erate the logic-based models (github.com/bhklab/RLOBICO). Results Bimodality of gene expression To comprehensively explore the space of bimodal gene expressions, we performed a genome-wide characterization of gene expression distribution in large sets of patient tumors and immortalized cancer cell lines., Using the gene expression data from the CCLE (945 cell lines from 23 tissue types 16), we determined the expression bimodality of a given gene by fitting a mixture of two Gaussian distributions across all samples and then calculating the bimodality index ( Fig., 1B ; ref. 9). We restricted this analysis to solid tumors as hematopoietic and lymphoid cell lines have distinctive molecular pro files and are generally more sensitive to chemical perturbations in comparison with solid tumors (18)., Similarly we computed the bimodality index for all genes using the gene expression of the solid tumors in TCGA (10, 534 tumors from 30 tissue types,  ref., 21). We subsequently selected the protein-coding genes that showed high bimodality index ( >80th percentile) in both cancer cell lines and patient tumors (2, 816 of 21, 903 genes,  Fig., 1C ; Supplementary Table S1). This set of bimodal genes showed in general, better reproducibility of expression status (high vs.low) than using the rest of the genes (Supplementary Fig., S1A; see Materials and Methods). Pathway enrichment analysis revealed a signi ficant association of bimodal genes with G protein  coupled receptor signaling (GPCR) related pathways (Supplementary Fig., S1B) which are involved in the modulation of PI3K pathway,  MAPK proteins, cAMP-dependent protein kinases,  and cellular Ca2(32)., Further characterization of these strongly bimodal genes revealed a low correlation (median Matthews correlation coef ficients, MCC 140.03, IQR 140.08) between their mRNA expression and hence low redundancy in the information they carry (Supplementary Fig., S1C). Development of interpretable models predictive of drug sensitivity We implemented a machine learning approach based on logic- based models to identify reliable and interpretable biomarkers of sensitivity to different drugs, building upon the recent LOBICO approach (28)., Logic-based models offer logic formulas using the AND OR,  and NOT operators to build multivariate, nonlinear,  yet interpretable predictive models., They overcome the limitations of univariate models that do not account for versatile gene dependencies., To make such models broadly available we developed RLOBICO, which is an R implementation of LOBICO method (28), to find binary rules that predict sensitivity of samples to different drugs., Several studies have shown that a reduced feature space improves the pre- dictivity and interpretability of drug sensitivity models (33 35)., ToBa-Alawi et al. Cancer Res 82(13) July 1,  2022 CANCER RESEARCH 2380Downloaded from http, //aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/82/13/2378/3177355/2378.pdf by University Health Network user on 20 November 2023 reduce the feature space and subsequent computational cost, we used the ensemble mRMRe feature selection strategy ( Fig., 1A ; ref. 36). The resulting models were represented as logic formulas including  10 genes to control the risk of over fitting and facilitate interpretation of the models., We assessed the predictive value of the logic models using the CI (see Materials and Methods; refs. 31, 37). Tofit the logic-based models we used the pharmacogenomic data from the CTRP by the Broad Institute, which represents one of the largest sets of drug response data publicly available to date (version 2, including 544 drugs,  refs., 5, 18), extracted from PharmacoGx (version 1.14.0; ref. 22). We excluded drugs for which less than 10% of tested cancer cell lines are sensitive [area above the drug dose response curve (AAC) 0.2, see Materials and Methods for AAC de finition]., Sup- plementary Figure S2 depicts the different filtration steps applied on the pharmacogenomic datasets., On the basis of our approach we were able to build models yielding a CI greater than 0.6 ( Pvalue <0.05) in a 5-fold cross-validation setting for 39.9% of the drugs in CTRPv2 (Fig., 2A ). CI>0.6 was chosen as a threshold to de fine robust models based on the evaluation of CI scores between 11 drugs of different drug classes and their associated known biomarkers (Supplementary Fig., S3; Supplementary Table S2). The models cover a wide spectrum of drug classes such as EGFR signaling inhibitors and RTK signaling inhibitors (Fig., 2B Supplementary Table S3) supporting the generalizability of the predictive value of bimodal genes., Interestingly we found that among all models chosen by our method to predict drug sensitivityusing the bimodal genes, 87% of multivariate models had a higher predictive value (CI) than univariate ones (Supplementary Fig S4)., Here for each drug,  we compared the best univariate model ( K141 AND M141, see Materials and Methods) to the best multivariate model ( K!141O R M!141, see Materials and Methods) on the same data., This supports observations by other studies that multivariate models have in general, better predictive power than univariate ones (1,  7,  38,  39)., However it is not always the case as some drugs are greatly in fluenced by speci fic gene alterations, for example,  dabrafenib is mainly predicted by BRAF status., The top-performing predictors included drugs targeting growth factor receptors such as EGFR ERBB2, and VEGFR., As mentioned earlier, the bimodal genes are enriched for several GPCR-related pathways. GPCRs are involved in cross-talks with growth factor receptors. Transactivation of EGFR in cancer cell lines by GPCRs such as chemokine and angiotensin II receptors has been reported extensively (40)., Persistent transactivation of EGFR and ErbB2/HER2 by protease-activated receptor-1 a GPCR activated by extracellular proteases, has been shown to promote breast carcinoma cell inva- sion (41)., In addition a strong complex formation between VEGFR2,  another major growth factor, and the GPCR b2adrenoceptor has been reported,  resulting in VEGFR2 activation (42)., Among our top- performing models we found that higher expression of FGF-binding protein 1 (FGFBP1) was correlated with increased sensitivity to erlotinib ( Fig., 2C ). FGFBP1 is a secreted chaperone that helps release Figure 2. A,Cross-validation performance of developed logical models for each drug in CTRPv2.

According to Verbist and colleagues (44) FGFBP1 gene expression is downregulated by erlotinib, resulting in decreased cell proliferation in cancer., These studies support our findings that high expression of FGFBP1 might be imparting sensi- tivity to erlotinib via the inhibition of FGFBP1-FGF signaling axis., EGFR expression a known biomarker for erlotinib, was excluded from our set of bimodal genes because its expression was not suf ficiently bimodal in the TCGA cohort., Yet we found a signi ficant correlation between predictions based on rules that our method generated for erlotinib and EGFR expression (PCC, 0.34,  Pvalue, 8.03E-18) suggest- ing that our method was able to find a surrogate mimicking EGFR association with erlotinib response., Moreover rules that our method generated for erlotinib had better association with erlotinib response (PCC, 0.36,  Pvalue,  1.63E-20) than EGFR expression (PCC,  0.29,  Pvalue,  2.17E-13)., Another example of the top-performing models is for the selective VEGFR inhibitor axitinib in which low expression of GPCR,  class C,  group 5, member A (GPRC5A) was shown to be predictive of response ( Fig., 2C ). GPRC5A also known as retinoic acid- induced gene 3 has been shown to elicit tissue-speci fic oncogenic and tumor-suppressive functions and is involved in the regulation of major cancer-related signaling pathways such as cAMP, NF- kB,  and STAT3 (45,  46)., Besides STAT3 and NF- kB signaling GPRC5A is reported to impact cell-cycle genes such as FEN1, MCM2,  CCND1,  and UBE2C in lung adenocarcinoma (47)., Knockout of GPRC5A has been reported to reduce proliferation and migration ability of PaCa cell lines and suppress the chemotherapy drug resistance of gemcitabine, oxaliplatin,  and fluorouracil in PaCa cells (48)., Knockdown of GPRC5A has also been found to negatively impact FAK/Src activation and RhoA GTPase activity,  the key mediators of VEGF signaling in cancer cell lines (49)., These findings support a possible mechanism for axitinib sensitivity imparted by low expression of GPRC5A, via VEGF- activated signaling intermediates., All trained models (CI >0.6) from CTRPv2 and their associated predictive rules are shared in the supplementary data (Supplementary File 1)., The prospect of tissue speci ficity for drug response predictions constitutes another layer of complexity., We investigated whether bimodal genes within a speci fic tissue could generate a more accurate predictor of sensitivity for samples of that tissue type., One challenge is the low number of samples within tissues which will impact thegeneral applicability of the generated bimodal genes (Supplementary Fig., S5; Supplementary Table S4). Lung cancer was chosen as a case study as the number of samples available in both CCLE (173 samples) and TCGA (1, 122 samples) is suf ficient to extract reliable bimodal genes., We applied our pipeline to these samples and developed logic- based models with minimum predictive value (CI >0.6) for about 30% of drugs in CTRPv2., ABT-737 a selective inhibitor of BCL-2 used in lung cancer therapy, was among the best performing models we found (CI140.78)., In addition we validated our predicted rules for this drug on an external dataset of lung cancer samples from the GDSC2 (2019, refs., 2, 3), CI 140.73. Furthermore we compared the pan-cancer and tissue-speci fic models on lung samples in the gCSI (2018,  refs., 19 20) dataset and GDSC2 and found that both feature sets yielded similar associations with response ( Fig., 3A andB). These results suggest that both sets of rules can be predictive of drug response and provide different levels of biomarker granularity., The variation in de fining bimodal genes is mostly due to the difference in the distributions of genes within tissues and across different cancer types., Bimodality of gene expressions is a rich source of predictive biomarkers To test whether the gene expression of the top bimodal genes composes a richer feature set for predicting drug response than other data types such as tissue of origin, mutation,  and CNV, we system- atically analyzed all the data types by running them through the same computational pipeline used for bimodal genes., Our results indicate that the expression of bimodal genes signi ficantly outperformed the other data types (mutations and CNV) in 72% of the drugs ( Fig., 4A andB). We also show that bimodal genes are not surrogates to tissue types in two ways. First for each drug, we compared drug sensitivity predictions based on RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) models to those based on tissue models and found a very low correlation between them (median MCC, 0.11,  IQR,  0, 09,  Fig., 4C ). Second we assessed the ability of each bimodal gene to predict any tissue type and found that no bimodal gene was able to fully predict a tissue type (See Materials and Methods, Supplementary Fig., S6). Tissue type of the sample was found to be the best model predicting sensitivity to 16% of the drugs suggesting a strong speci ficity of drug response ( Fig., 4D ; ref. 50). Dabrafenib for example,  is an inhibitor of BRAF serine-threonine kinase, which was predicted by our model to show a high association with skin cancer ( Fig., 4D ). This drug is indeed approved by FDA as a single agent for the treatment of patients with unresectable or Figure 3., Comparing lung-speci fic rules versus pan-cancer rules in predicting drug response within lung samples in gCSI ( A) and GDSC2 ( B).Ba-Alawi et al., Cancer Res 82(13) July 1,  2022 CANCER RESEARCH 2382Downloaded from http, //aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/82/13/2378/3177355/2378.pdf by University Health Network user on 20 November 2023 metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E (51)., Mutation and CNV features were found to be the best in predicting sensitivity in 11.2% of the drugs ( Fig., 4E andF). An example of these drugs is Nutlin-3A, an MDM2 inhibitor that activates wild-type p53 (52). TP53 wild-type was predicted by our approach to indicate sensitivity to Nutlin-3A (Fig. 4E ). This outperformance of expression data in comparison with other data types conforms with previous studies and community efforts that investigated the relevance of different data types to predict drug sensitivity and showed that gene expression has more rich information and predictive power than other data types in general (7)., Nevertheless some drugs responses are still better predicted by other data types such as mutations, CNVs,  and tissue types., These results also suggest that combining these different data types in a multi-omics model could improve the resultant predictors given the heterogeneity of the chosen feature sets we observed for different drugs ( Fig., 4A ). Validation of drug response predictors Recognizing that large-scale pharmacogenomic studies employ complex, potentially noisy experimental protocols (20,  53), it is crucial to validate the performance of our new predictors in fully independent datasets to assess their generalizability., Therefore we validated our models on two large pan-cancer pharmacogenomic datasets, namely gCSI and GDSC2,  both included in our PharmacoGx package (22)., Among all the models in common with gCSI our models achieved 92% validation rate (12 drugs of 13 in common with CTRPv2 for which training CI >0.6, Fig., 5A ; Supplementary Fig. S2). On GDSC2 our models achieved a validation rate of 61% (16 drugs of 26 in common with CTRPv2 for which training CI >0.6, Fig., 5B ; SupplementaryFig. S2). To put these rates in perspective, Supplementary Fig. S3 shows the CI scores between 11 drugs of different drug classes and their associated known biomarkers (Supplementary Table S2)., If we con- sider each biomarker as a different model and consider CI >0.6 to be a validated model we would achieve 19% validation in this small set of known biomarkers models., There were 7 of 9 (78%) predictive models that were validated on both external datasets ( Fig. 5 ), strongly supporting the generalizability of the logic rules predictive of drug response. Dasatinib whose predictive logic model was also validated in GDSC2 and gCSI, showed association with several genes including high mobility group AT-Hook 2 (HMGA2)., HMGA2 is a member of the HMG protein family that binds to the DNA minor groove at sequences rich in A and T nucleotides, and acts as a transcriptional regulator., Apart from its role as a transcriptional co-regulator HMGA2 has been found to induce EMT in lung cancer (54)., HMGA2 also functions as a positive regulator of cell proliferation and its expression is implicated as a prospective diagnostic biomarker in the assessment of endometrial serous cancer (55)., According to Turkson J. and colleagues (56) nuclear Src and p300 associate with HMGA2 promoter and regulate its gene expression in PDAC patient samples., Src inhibition by dasatinib might negatively impact HMGA2 mediated cell oncogenesis resulting in sensitivity in cancers with high HMGA2 expression as predicted in our study., Among the other top-performing drugs the sensitivity of ge fitinib, an EGFR inhibitor has been attributed to the expression of ARHGAP8, a gene implicated in EGFR-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation and oncogenesis (57,  58)., The expression of other bimodal genes associated with lapatinib sensitivity such as Figure 4.

Our results showed a signi ficant validation of the erlotinib logic model on PDXE lung samples (CI 0.63 and Pvalue,  1.12E-02,  Fig 6 )., Growth curves and angle scores for the PDXs treated with erlotinib can be found in Supplementary Fig S7., These results suggest that predictors based on bimodal gene expressions can be translated from in vitro toin vivo cancer models., One of the major bottlenecks of biomarker predictions is its translatability to the clinic. The ultimate aim of this work is to provide models and biomarkers that can aid in treatment decisions., In addition to the cross-validation on preclinical data we sought to assess the extent of translatability of our models to patient data., We used a rich clinical genomics dataset from the HMF (https//www.hartwigmedicalfoundation.nl), where molecular data of patients of over 30 cancer types is coupled with therapy response measured in clinical trial settings., We found that three drugs (pazopanib doxorubicin, gemci- tabine) with at least one positive outcome in HARTWIG dataset intersect with our set of predictive models with a lowered CI threshold of 0.55., Among these models, we were able to validate two drugs (Fig. 7 ). In this analysis for each drug, we applied the in vitro generated rules to classify HMF patients into respondent/nonrespondents and compared that to the RECIST response on those patients ( Fig., 7 ; Supplementary Table S5). Collectively these results support the reliability of our predictive models paving the way for more ef ficient designs of molecular targets and betterment of biomarkers used by clinicians., Discussion Bimodality of gene expression represents an interesting phenom- enon associated with several biological processes., One of the advan- tages of bimodal genes as biomarkers is that they can be used to robustly classify samples into two distinct expression states based on their modes, allowing for easier interpretation and translation of the biomarker into the clinic., In this study we showed that top bimodal genes are mostly associated with extracellular membrane pathways, which have a downstream effect on important cancer-related processes Figure 5., Validating developed logic models on external datasets.

However it is not bimodal in TCGA, which excluded it from our set of bimodal genes that we used for training the models., Yet as shown earlier, we found a high concordance between predictions based on rules our method generated for erlotinib and EGFR expression, suggesting that bimodal genes could still capture information related to those genes that were filtered out., Despite the constraint on the number of bimodal genes we use we have shown that this set of features along with our novel method of applying logic-based models was able to predict sensitivity to 101 drugs from 17 different drug classes, suggesting global utility of these features ( Fig., 2B ).We also showed that in general,  bimodal genes outperformed other data types, mutations and CNV,  in predicting sensitivity to different drugs., Though, few drugs are still better predicted by genomic features. An interesting follow-up to this analysis would be to investigate the complementary effect of merging these data types in building more accurate models., Challenges that we anticipate are the availability of data types across datasets data normalization and computational complexity to search the larger search space for candidate rules., This study has potential limitations. First the computational cost of the CPLEX optimizer used to train the logical models is limiting the development of predictors including more than a few dozen muta- tions, CNV and bimodal genes, this limitation could be overcome by the development of new heuristic approaches in the future., Second a better translation of the bimodal gene expression features from in vitro to the clinic could be achieved by incorporating data from system models such as organoids and PDXs., However, there is yet no large compendium of such data that can be used for this purpose. Still our study provides a way to translate the bimodal genes extracted from in vitro samples to the clinic by intersecting them with patient data from TCGA., Third, our study shows the potential of tissue-speci fic models to predict drug sensitivity. However we could not showcase many tissues due to the low number of samples within tissues in the datasets used in this study., Finally with more pharmacogenomic studies being generated, we will have more common drugs across datasets,  providing richer data for independent validation, which is crucial to ensure robustness and accuracy of the generated models., Figure 6.

      "answer": "The abstract of the paper discusses the challenge of identifying biomarkers that can predict cancer cell responses to drug treatments, a key aspect of precision oncology. It highlights recent advancements in pharmacogenomic studies that have profiled numerous cancer cell lines and tested them against various drugs. While many predictive models have been developed using statistical and machine learning methods, they often lack interpretability, which hampers their clinical application. To address this, the authors present a new machine learning pipeline that utilizes a logic modeling approach to analyze bimodally expressed genes across large pharmacogenomic datasets. This method produces interpretable, multivariate models that predict drug responses for over 100 drugs across 17 classes, demonstrating high validation rates in independent datasets. The findings suggest that bimodal gene expression can serve as reliable biomarkers for drug sensitivity, enhancing the potential for clinical translation of these predictive models."

      "question": "Describe the methodology used in the paper.",
      "answer": "The methodology used in the paper involves several key steps to develop interpretable biomarkers for drug sensitivity based on bimodal gene expression. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the methodology:\n\n1. **Data Collection and Processing**: The study utilized multiple large-scale pharmacogenomic datasets, including the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRPv2), Genentech Cell Line Screening Initiative (gCSI), Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC2), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). These datasets were processed using the PharmacoGx R package to generate gene expression profiles.\n\n2. **Characterization of Bimodality**: The authors characterized the bimodality of gene expression profiles by fitting the distribution of each gene into a mixture of two Gaussian distributions. A bimodality score was calculated for each gene, and genes with a good fit were selected. The top 80th percentile of bimodal genes was chosen based on their bimodality scores from both CCLE and TCGA datasets.\n\n3. **Binarization of Gene Expression**: A binarization cutoff for each gene was established to distinguish between low and high expression states. This was done by calculating the average point between the modes of the fitted Gaussian distributions.\n\n4. **Feature Selection**: To reduce the feature space and enhance model interpretability, the authors employed a minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMRe) feature selection method. This approach selected the most relevant and complementary features from the top bimodal genes.\n\n5. **Logic-Based Modeling**: The authors developed a machine learning pipeline using logic-based models, specifically an R implementation of the Logic Optimization for Binary Input to Continuous Output (LOBICO) method. This method constructs Boolean logic functions to model the relationship between the selected bimodal gene features and drug sensitivity.\n\n6. **Model Training and Validation**: The models were trained using the area above the dose-response curve (AAC) as a metric for drug efficacy. A threshold of AAC <0.2 was used to classify samples as resistant, while AAC >0.2 classified them as sensitive. The models were evaluated using a modified concordance index (CI) to assess the predictive performance.\n\n7. **Cross-Validation**: A 5-fold cross-validation approach was employed to ensure that there was no information leakage between training and test sets. The models were validated on independent datasets (gCSI and GDSC2) to assess their generalizability.\n\n8. **Clinical Validation**: The predictive models were further validated using clinical data from the HARTWIG Medical Foundation, where the models were applied to classify patients into responder and non-responder categories based on the generated rules.\n\n9. **Statistical Analysis**: The authors used various statistical metrics, including precision and F1 scores, to evaluate the robustness of the bimodal genes and their predictive capabilities across different datasets.\n\nOverall, the methodology combines data processing, statistical analysis, machine learning, and validation steps to develop interpretable biomarkers for predicting drug sensitivity in cancer treatment."

      "question": "Are there any contradictions between this paper's findings and previous research?",
      "answer": "The findings of the paper suggest that bimodal gene expression can serve as a reliable source of predictive biomarkers for drug sensitivity in cancer, outperforming traditional genomic features such as mutations and copy-number variations (CNVs). This aligns with previous research that has indicated gene expression as a more effective predictor of drug response compared to other molecular features. However, the paper also highlights a limitation in that many known drug biomarkers, which are not bimodal, were excluded from their analysis. For instance, the well-established biomarker EGFR for erlotinib was not included due to its non-bimodal expression in the analyzed datasets.\n\nThis presents a potential contradiction with previous studies that have identified EGFR as a critical biomarker for predicting response to EGFR inhibitors. While the current study found that their bimodal gene-based models could still correlate with EGFR expression and predict drug sensitivity, it raises questions about the completeness of their approach. The exclusion of non-bimodal genes may overlook important biomarkers that could enhance predictive accuracy.\n\nAdditionally, while the paper asserts that bimodal gene expression provides a more interpretable and reproducible framework for biomarker discovery, it acknowledges that some drugs are still better predicted by genomic features, suggesting that the superiority of bimodal gene expression is not absolute and may vary depending on the specific context or drug in question.\n\nIn summary, while the paper's findings support the utility of bimodal gene expression in drug sensitivity prediction, they also highlight a nuanced relationship with previous research, particularly regarding the exclusion of established biomarkers and the varying predictive power of different molecular features."
