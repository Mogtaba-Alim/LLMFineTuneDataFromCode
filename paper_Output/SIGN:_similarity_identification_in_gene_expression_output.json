Enrichment of pathways and their activity have been used as fea- tures in machine learning frameworks to predict identity of cells, mech-anism of action of drugs or mechanism of resistance of cancer cells(Karr et al.,  2012 , Michelson and Young,  2011,  Silberberg et al.,  2012 )., To facilitate this process we develope d SIGN (Similarity Identification in Gene expressioN) as an open-s ource R package., The expression VCThe Author(s) 2019.

These features are then used in a centroid classification scheme for supervised learning tasks. We further introducethe transcriptional similarity coeffi cient (TSC) an estimator of gene ex- pression pattern similarity of pathwa y activity between biological sam- ples based on the RV statistic ( Smilde et al., 2 0 0 9 )., We used SIGN to classify breast tumors into subtypes and predict survival of patients inthe Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium(METABRIC) cohort ( Curtis et al., 2012 )., We show that SIGN yields higher performance with respect to the top performing approaches from the community DREAM challenge for br east cancer survival prediction (Margolin et al., 2013 )., 2 Materials and methods We applied SIGN for subtype clustering and patient survival prediction using the transcriptom ic profiles of patient tumors., The underlying centroid classification within SIGN is used to stratify patientswith good survival from poor survival patients relying on gene expres- sion profiles of their corresponding tumors., We further hypothesizedthat gene expression patterns biologi cal pathways as the relative expres- sion of genes within the pathway, are determinants of cell identity., Wedefined TSC as a new way for comparing patterns of expression of bio-logical pathways between tumors., Widely used pathway databases such as KEGG and Reactome as well as Gene Ontology (GO) terms canbe used as set of pathways in SIGN., GO terms in level C5 with 1030number of genes are used in this study to identify the similarity betweensamples based on their gene expression pattern ( Liberzon et al., 2011 )., We limited the number of genes in GO terms to exclude large GO terms(at the top of GO term hierarchy) that are parents of the GO terms inour study (at the bottom of the GO hierarchy)., 2.1 Transcriptional similarity coefficient LetPbe the matrix of expression of genes within a pathway for a set of biological samples where rows are genes and columns are sam-ples., SIGN defines the TSC between the two matrices using modifiedRV coefficient ( Smilde et al. 2009 ) as follows TSC P 1, P2  14P iP10/C2P20 iiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffiP ijP102 ijq /C2ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffiP ijP202 ijqr where P1andP2represent the matrix of gene expressions of a given pathway in two set of samples (population 1 and 2), iis row index (i.e., gene index) within each matrix, jis column index (i.e. sample index) within each matrix and Pm0 Pm014Pm/C2P0 m/C0Diagonal Pm/C2P0 m/C0/C1 where the Diagonal function sets to zero the elements of the matrix that a r en o ti nt h ed i a g o n a l .T h er a n g eo ft h eT S Cs c o r el i e sb e t w e e n[ /C01, 1]., Higher scores indicates higher similarity of gene expression patternof a given pathway between two populations., Therefore TSC repre-sents the similarity of a given pathway activity between two samplesand/or sample sets., We identify similarity of pathways between twosample sets relying on distribution of TSCs between the populations., 2.2 Breast cancer subtype similarity We used TSC as the measure of similarity of ESR1 and ERBB2 genemodule activities ( Haibe-Kains et al., , 2012 ) between breast tumorsamples in the discovery cohort of METABRIC. The similarities be- tween the samples were used to identify total Euclidean distance be-tween the samples and cluster them accordingly., 2.2 Survival analysis We assessed performance of SIGN to predict the overall survival ofpatients as an endpoint., We split the discovery cohort in METABRIC(Curtis et al. 2 0 1 2 ) for patients under the same treatment category (Hormonal therapy,  Chemo hormonal therapy, chemotherapy or under no drug treatment),  into three groups of poor (10%), inter-mediate (80%) and good (10%) survival., We defined Delta 14similarity to good survival cohort /C0similarity to poor survival cohort and used it to identify difference of similarity of each patient tumor sample to good and poor survival populations., To assess the signifi-cance of the predictions using log-rank test we binarized Delta asbeing Delta or Delta /C0., Log-rank function implemented in the survcomp R package (1.32.0) ( Schroder et al., 2011 ). 2.3 Research reproducibility SIGN is publicly available as an open-source R package (https // cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SIGN/ ) and the results of this art- icle can be reproduced using the cloud-based computational repro-ducibility platform CodeOcean (http, //bit.ly/2PMwegY)., 3 Results We leveraged the METABRIC dataset of breast cancer patients totest whether TSC can be used to recapitulate subtyping of breastcancer patients., We used TSC comparing expression patterns withinsignatures of luminal basal and HER2 breast cancer subtypes (Desmedt et al., , 2008 ;Gendoo et al. , 2016 ;Haibe-Kains et al. , 2012 ) between tumor samples in discovery cohort of METABRIC. Clustering of the tumor samples relying on the identified TSCsagreed with different breast cancer subtyping methods, SCMOD2(Haibe-Kains et al., , 2012 ) and PAM50 ( Parker et al. , 2009 ), as well as histopathological status of ER and HER2 ( Fig. 1A ).

Schematic representation of Similarity Identification in Gene expressioN (SIGN) and transcriptional similarity coefficient (TSC)., ( A) Gene Ontology (GO) terms (BP biological processes,  MF,  molecular functions,  CC, cellular components),  or other pathway datasets, are used to identify similarity between samples., ( B)T S C is used to identify similarity of expression pattern of the genes within a given path- way between two sets of samples., ( C) Collection of TSCs pathways between two sets of samples are used in unsupervised or supervised learning schemesSIGN 4831 Comparing three subtypes of breast cancer including using TSC illustrated ability of TSC for identifying true similarities betweenbreast tumor samples ( Fig., 2A ). We further used overall survival as an endpoint to examine ability of SIGN as a classification framework, using TSC as a measure ofsimilarity in stratifying patients based on their risk., Breast tumors aretraditionally categorized to different subtypes in clinical setting usingtheir histopathological or genomic information ( Curtis et al., ,2 0 1 2 ; Sotiriou et al.,2 0 0 6 ). The patients in each subtype are then assigned to different therapeutics available and approved for that subtype(Table 1 )(Goldhirsch et al., ,2 0 1 1 ). Hence patients under different therapeutic regimen have different underlying biology and will havedifferent survival rate ( Fig., 2B ). For example patients with luminal breast cancer receive hormonal therapy and have higher survival ratewith respect to patients with basal-like tumor type that receivechemotherapy ( Table 1 , Fig., 2B ). To account for treatment differen- ces we applied SIGN, using TSC as measure of gene expression pat-tern similarity between patient gene expression profiles under similartherapeutic regimen in the discovery cohort of METABRIC., We defined poor and good survival groups as the patients who die the earliest after diagnosis and the patients who survived thelongest (10% of the cohort in each category)., We then used the poor and good survival patient cohorts to train the model and check val-idity of the model in stratifying patients., We considered the rest ofthe population patients with intermediate survival, as test set to as-sess the performance of SIGN in patient stratification., For each pa-tient the difference between the similarity with the poor and goodgroups is computed so that patients with positive Delta are predictedto have higher survival than the patients with negative Delta., Weassessed the prognostic value of Delta using the log-rank test foreach treatment group separately ( Fig., 2C ). SIGN yielded significant prognostic value for all the treatment groups of patients under dif-ferent therapeutic regimen, except the patients who received bothhormonal therapy and chemotherapy (referred to as Chemo/Hormo, Fig., 2C ). The patients under Chemo/Hormo are patients with ag- gressive luminal breast tumor who received chemotherapy uponshowing low response to hormonal therapy., Tumors in this cohortof patients have high heterogeneity and different underlying biologyis potentially responsible for low response rate or even recurrenceafter hormonal therapy ( Shipitsin et al., , 2007 ). We examined use of patient tumor profiles under only hormonal therapy or chemother-apy for predicting survival of patients under Chemo/Hormo., Tumorprofile of patients under hormonal therapy were more informative with respect to patients under chemotherapy, for predicting survivalof patients under chemo/hormonotherapy ( Fig., 2D ). We validated performance of SIGN trying to predict survival of patients in the validation cohort of METABRIC ( Curtis et al., 2012 )., SIGN could significantly predict survival of breast cancer patients inthe validation cohort ( Fig. 2E ). We further compared the performance of SIGN with the best 10 predictive models from the DREAM chal- lenge ( Bilal et al., 2013 ),  to predict breast cancer patient survival using gene expression profiles of tumors, that showcased SIGN as the bestmodel ( Fig., 2F ). We further showed SIGN outperformed than the best 10 predictive models from the DREAM challenge to predict breast can- cer patient survival., The baseline model is the cox regression modeltrained and tested using clinical features such as ER status,  HER2 sta-tus,  tumor size,  age,  grade, Lymph node status and assigned treatment(Bilal et al.,  2013 )., Moreover PAM50 subtypes of breast tumor sam- ples in discovery cohort of METABRIC were not significant predictorsof survival if added to the baseline clinical model ( P-value >0.4)., In conclusion SIGN is a classification tool that can be applied to predict cell identity and stratify patients based on their survival.With the increasing amount of gene expression and transcriptomicdata, SIGN can be used in other applications,  such as patient stratifi-cation across other cancer types, identification of different cell phe-notypes and identification of mechanism of action of drugs usingtheir genomic perturbation data ( El-Hachem et al., 2017 )., Acknowledgements The authors thank the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) for sharing their valuable data with the scientific community., Fig. 2.
