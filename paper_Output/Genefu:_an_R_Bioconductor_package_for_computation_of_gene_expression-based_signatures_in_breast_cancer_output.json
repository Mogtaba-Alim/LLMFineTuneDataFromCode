These are Her2-enriched (also called HER2 ) Triple-negative breast cancers (ER /C0/HER2 /C0/PR/C0, similar to basal-like) and Luminal-like which are mainly ER /HER2 /C0that could be further discriminated into luminal A and B based on their low and high proliferativephenotype, respectively., These classifications have showed that breast cancer is not a single disease but is rather highly heterogeneous., Breastcancer subtypes exhibit distinct trans criptomic patterns that are associ- ated with outcome which emphasizes the relevance of these subtypesfor basic and translational research ( Sotiriou and Pusztai, 2009 )., Among various molecular techniques gene expression profiling in particular has increasingly been used to refine breast cancer stratifica-tion, and to assess prognosis and response to therapy ( Pratet al.,  2012 )., Studies to identify gene expression patterns of clinical potential have VCThe Author 2015.

Subtype- specific prognoses however are also largely dependent on the properidentification of the major biological subtypes., The parallel develop-ment of breast cancer subtyping methods has also produced a signifi-cant number of classification algorithms, with diverse taxonomies., The large body of literature on the molecular complexity of breast cancer has introduced a burden of computational complexity for re-searchers., The advent of high-throughput genomics and next-gener-ation sequencing promises unprecedented views into the majorbiological breast cancer subtypes ( Schnitt, 2010 )., However there is a dire need for an accessible, computat ional platform that can easily sus- tain the growing variety of breast can cer classification and prognostic algorithms., This will facilitate both meta-analyses of breast cancer dataas well as cross comparison of diffe rent computational methods., Here we have developed the genefu package, a multi-leveled compendium that provides bioinformatics implem entations of classification algo- rithms to identify molecular subtypes, as well as prognostic predictorsalong with their published gene signatures ( Table 1 , Supplementary Fig., S1 ). Notably we have incorporated the most recently developed molecular subtyping algorithms in the field, including the IntClust (Curtis et al.,  2012 ), the IHC4 prognostic scoring algorithm ( Dowsett et al.,  2013 ), the Absolute Intrinsic Molecular Subypting (AIMS) algo- rithm ( Paquet and Hallett,  2015 ), as well as the classification algorithm for prediction of claudin-low breast cancer samples ( Pratet al., 2010 )., The package also includes other functions to facilitate quick manipula-tion of gene expression datasets, including gene selection and probe-gene mapping across microarray platforms., 2 Molecular subtyping We have implemented nine molecular subtyping algorithms withingenefu which facilitates the identification of molecular subtypes as well as assessment of stratified patient data., We compare here themolecular subtype predictions across five public datasets using thePAM50 and SCMOD2 algorithms., Both PAM50 and SCMOD2 pre- dict patients that belong to the Basal-like and Her2-enriched sub-types, as well as distinguish between the Luminal A (LumA) andLuminal B (LumB) subtypes., PAM50 additionally identifies nor-mal-like patients. Overall, there is a concordance of /C2485% between both predictors ( Supplementary Data S1 ). Despite the lack of com- plete concordance between the two algorithms patient survivalacross subtypes is virtually identical between the two subtypingschemes ( Fig., 1 A). Notably survival is the highest for LumA pa- tients,  while patients LumB, Her2-enriched and Basal-like tumorsdisplay the poorest survival., This indicates that different molecularsubtyping algorithms are consistent and yield similar prognosticvalue across breast cancer subtypes., 3 Prognostication of breast cancer Our implementation of numerous prognostic predictors as part ofgenefu facilitates meta-analysis of prognostic signatures across sev- eral breast cancer datasets., We previously demonstrated that themajority of prognostic signatures show similar performance despitelimited genetic overlaps between them ( Desmedt et al., , 2008 ; Wirapati et al. , 2008 ). We showed that many of published gene sig- natures were affected by the presence of proliferation-related genes, rendering the signature informative for prognosis of ER /HER2 /C0 patients, but less informative for basal-like and HER2-enriched pa-tients., To improve prognostication for these subtypes we imple-mented a new risk prediction model, called GENIUS, which uses afuzzy computational approach combining risk prediction modelsspecific to each molecular subtype ( Haibe-Kains et al., , 2010 ). We have subsequently demonstrated that Gaussian-based clusteringbased on gene sets specifically correlated with the ER, HER2 andAURKA genes can robustly identify breast cancer molecular sub-types ( Haibe-Kains et al., 2012 )., In this case study we used genefu to conduct a meta-analysis of 12 risk predictors across 71 3 node-negative, untreate d breast cancer patients (Supplementary Data S1 )., For comparison three of our predictors were based on using just one of three key breast cancer genes (representedhere as AURKA, ESR1 and ERBB2)., We calculated the risk score per-formance of each predictor measured by the concordance index, acrossthe five breast cancer datasets ( Supplementary Fig., S2 ). The concordance index estimates the probability that, for a random pair of patients, the Table 1.

Our findings suggest significant prognostic val ue for all multi-gene predictors. Notably using a single prolifer ation gene (AURKA) produces a similar performance to the majority of other predictors., 4 Application across data platforms Many of the molecular subtyping algorithms and gene expression sig-natures implemented within genefu have originally been derived from microarray gene expression data., This raises an important question asto whether such methods can be used on data generated on RNAsequencing platforms., We have previously compared the agreementbetween microarray and RNAs sequencing platforms on several prog-nostic signatures and classifiers from genefu (Fumagalli et al., 2 0 1 4 )., This analysis was conducted on six molecular subtyping algorithms(SCMOD1 SCMO2,  SCMGENE,  SSP2003, SSP2006 and PAM50)and several prognostic-driven signatures including GENE70,  GGI,  RORS, ENDOPREDICT, among other gene expression signatures.We have demonstrated that the clinically relevant single genes andgene expression signatures originally defined by microarray technol-ogy can be used to reliably evaluate RNA sequencing data., The codefor this analysis is additionally available on github at https://github.com/bhklab/DNA11161. 5 Conclusions Thegenefu package provides a unified framework for integration of molecular subtype and survival analysis of breast cancer., We havedemonstrated how the package can be utilized to perform bothmeta-analyses across datasets and across algorithms, to facilitateintegrated analysis of breast cancer gene expression profiles., Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank Dr. Michael Hallet for sharing his feedback and experiences regarding implementation of some of the breast cancer mo-lecular subtyping schemes., Funding CIBC-Brain Canada Brain Cancer Research Training Award to DMAG.
