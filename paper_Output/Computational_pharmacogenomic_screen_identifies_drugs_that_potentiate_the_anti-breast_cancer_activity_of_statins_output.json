polypharmacology of dipyridamole we focus our pharmacogenomics pipe line on mevalonate pathway genes, which we name mevalonate drug-networ k fusion (MVA-DNF)., We validate top- ranked compounds nel finavir and honokiol, and identify that low expression of the canonical epithelial cell marker,  E -cadherin, is associated with statin- compound synergy., Analysis of remaining prioritized hits led to the validationof additional compounds clotrimazo le and vemurafenib., Thus our compu- tational pharmacogeno mic approach identi fies actionable compounds with pathway-speci fic activities., Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer (BC) that has a poorer prognosis compared to othermajor BC subtypes 1., This poor prognosis stems from our limited understanding of the underlying biology the relative lack of targetedtherapeutics, and the associated risk of distant metastases occurringpredominantly in the first two years after diagnosis 2., Cytotoxic anthracycline and taxane-based chemotherapy regimens remain theprimary option for treating TNBC, with other classes of investigationalagents in various stages of development., Therefore novel and effec-tive therapeutics are urgently needed to combat this dif ficult-to-treat cancer., Altered cellular metabolism is a hallmark of cancer 34, a n dt a r g e t - ing key metabolic pathways can provide new anticancer therapeuticstrategies., Aberrant activation of the mevalonate (MVA) metabolic pathway is a hallmark of many cancers including TNBC, as the end-products include cholesterol and other non-sterol isoprenoids essen-tial for cellular proliferation and survival 57., The statin family of FDA- approved cholesterol-lowering drugs are potent inhibitors of the rate-limiting enzyme

showed statin use was associated with reduced tumor cell proliferationand increased apoptosis of high-grade BCs 20, 21., Collectively this evi- dence suggests that statins have potential utility in the treatment of BC, including TNBC., While these clinical trials have been promising there remains a gap in understanding of how best to use statins asanticancer agents., Several options i nclude increasing the therapeutic dose of statins prescribed or by using cholesterol-lowering dosesof statins in combination with other compounds to increase theanticancer activity of statins., Drug combinations that overcomeresistance mechanisms and maximize ef ficacy have potential advan- tages as cancer therapeutic strategies., This can be particularlyimpactful when the agents have been

Dipyridamole is a FDA-approved antiplatelet agent commonly used for secondary stroke prevention and since the statin-dipyridamole combination has been co-prescribed for other indica-tions, it may be safely used in the treatment of cancer 27.H o w e v e r , t h e exact mechanism of dipyridamole action remains unclear, as it has been reported to regulate several biological processes in addition toblocking SREBP-mediated feedback 28., Moreover the antiplatelet activity of dipyridamole may be a contraindication for some cancerpatients., Here we show that by identifying additional compounds that potentiate the pro-apoptotic activity of statins, we bring the effectiveconcentration of statins into a clinically achievable range and increasethe utility of statins as anticancer agents in a timely manner., To thisend we developed a computational pharmacogenomics pipeline thatidenti fied compounds with similar properties to our prototypic com- pound, dipyridamole,  at the level of structure,  antiproliferative activ- ity, and MVA pathway gene expression perturbations., By focusing ouranalysis on the MVA pathway we aimed to enrich for compounds thatpotentiate statin-induced apoptosis., The rapid computational phar-macogenomics pipeline that we developed successfully identi fied several compounds that synergise with statins in both cell line andpatient-derived organoid models to drive tumor cell death., Mechan-istically several of these compounds potentiated statin anticanceractivity by blocking the restorative feedback response of the MVApathway., These included nel finavir a FDA-approved antiretroviral drug,  and honokiol, a compound originally isolated from Magnolia spp.W ei d e n t i fied E-cadherin ( CDH1) expression as a predictive bio- marker of response to these combination therapies., We further eval-uated the remaining hits from the in silico screen and validatedadditional compounds as potentiators of fluvastatin-induced cell death., Two of these blocked the feedback response including clo-trimazole,  an antifungal medication, and vemurafenib,  a FDA-approved BRAF V600E inhibitor., Taken together we provide an insilico strategy to identify compounds that behave in a pathway-speci fic manner, and suggest this time-, cost- and labor-ef ficient approach will have broad utility for compound discovery across a wide variety ofdrug/pathway interactions., Results Computational pharmacogenomic pipeline identi fies com- pounds that potentiate fluvastatin-induced cancer cell death and block the SREBP2-mediated feedback response We developed a computational pharmacogenomic pipeline to identify compounds that synergise with statins by blocking the statin-inducedSREBP2-mediated restorative feedback response (Fig., 1a, b). Pre- viously we successfully identi fied one agent,  dipyridamole, that potentiates statins by blocking this feedback loop,  however,  itinvolved a time-, cost- and labor-intensive drug screening approach., Our goal here was to identify additi onal agents with these activities using an in-silico approach. Building upon our previous study 29 w e selected the LINCS-L1000 (L1000)30and NCI-6031datasets to mine the cellular drug response at the molecular and proliferative levels across apanel of cancer cell lines., From these datasets we extracted drugstructure,  drug-cell line sensitivity pro files, and drug-induced gene perturbation data (gene expression changes after drug treatment) for238 compounds common to both datasets., We restricted the drug-gene perturbation layer of the L1000 dataset to only include the sixMVA pathway genes ( ACLY, ACAT2,  HMGCS1,  HMGCR,  FDFT1,  and INSIG1) present in the L1000 landmark gene set., We took this pathway- centric approach to strategically enrich the selection of candidate compounds that possess activity targeting the MVA pathway, but not other biological processes (Supplementary Fig., 1a, b). Using dipyr-idamole as our reference input we generated a MVA pathway-speci fic Drug Network Fusion (MVA-DNF) through the integration of threedistinct data layers, drug structure,  drug-cell line sensitivity pro files, and MVA gene-speci fic drug perturbation signatures., For each of the data layers incorporated into MVA-DNF a 238  238 drug af finity matrix was generated, indicating similarity for a selected drug againstall other drugs (further described in methods)., Brie fly we first com- puted the similarity between pairs of drug structures using the Tani- moto index, prior to generating the structure af finity matrix., We computed the similarity for every pair of drug sensitivity pro files using the Pearson correlation coef ficient, prior to generating an af finity matrix for the drug sensitivity layer., To create an af finity matrix for the MVA-speci fic perturbation layer to enrich compounds that act on the MVA pathway, we first calculated the Pearson correlation coef ficient on the drug perturbation signatures that were filtered to include only MVA genes (Fig., 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1a). By integrating the three affinity matrices using similarity network fusion 32 a n d filtering hits using permutation testing, we subsequently identi fied 19 compounds that scored as signi ficant (permutation test p-value <0.05 and z-score <1.8) (Fig., 1b, Supplementary Table 1, and further explained in methods). Represented as a network most hits displayed strongconnectivity to dipyridamole, the input compound,  as well as to eachother (Fig., 1b). Since we integrated three independent layers of data (drug structure drug-cell line sensitivity and drug-gene perturbation) toidentify these compounds, we investigated the contribution of thedifferent data layers for each of the compounds., Drug perturbationplayed a signi ficant role for most compounds compared to drug sen- sitivity and drug structure (Fig., 1c). This re flects the speci ficity of the MVA-DNF towards identifying compounds that may have a role in the SREBP2-mediated feedback loop of the MVA pathway, and ultimatelythe potentiation of statins., Further assessment of the six MVA-pathwaygene expression changes within the drug perturbation signatureshighlights comparable expression perturbation pro files between dipyridamole and the identi fied compounds (Supplementary Fig., 1b). To prioritize and further interrogate the 19 hits we first excluded two compounds from further analysis as they were not clinically useful, chromomycin A3,  a reported toxin 33,  and cadmium chloride,  an established carcinogen34., The remaining 17 compounds are distributed into nine distinct categories based on reported mechanism of action and potential clinical utility, demonstrating that the hits identi fied through the pharmacogenomics pipeline spanned a diverse chemicaland biological space (Supplementary Fig., 1b Supplementary Table 1).Wefirst evaluated the top five hits for their ability to potentiate fluvastatin-induced cell death and block the SREBP2-mediated feed- back response., These five compounds belonged to four different categories RAF/MEK inhibitor (selumetinib), antiretroviral (nel finavir),  anthracycline (doxorubicin,  mitoxantrone), and natural product(honokiol)., The reliability of our approach is evidenced by previouswork by our lab and others who have identi fied the lovastatin- doxorubicin combination to potentiate cancer cell death in ovarian cancer cells 35., Moreover RAF/MEK inhibitors such as PD98059,  and more recently selumetinib (AZD6244), have been reported to syner-gise with statins to further potentiate cancer cell death 36, 37.T a k e n together, the previously reported compound (selumetinib) along withthe three compounds (nel finavir, mitoxantrone,  and honokiol) were advanced for further evaluation (Supplementary Table 1)., To test whether our in silico pipeline would yield reciprocal hits we ran the pipeline using nel finavir and honokiol from the initial set of top drug hits., This identi fied dipyridamole and honokiol as top hits to nelfinavir and identi fied dipyridamole and nel finavir as top hits to honokiol (Supplementary Fig., 1c), demonstrating that the pipeline isrobust and succeeds in selecting for reciprocal drug hits. To further test the robustness and stability of our algorithm we assessed the time and memory consumption spent when running multiple iterations ofMVA-DNF and permutation testing, with varying gene sizes in the drugperturbation layer (further described in methods)., Our algorithmdemonstrated stable processing time (CPU time in seconds) andArticle https //doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33144-9 Nature Communications | (2022) 13, 6323 3 memory consumption (in megabytes), irrespective of whether small or large numbers of genes were used to generate the pathway-centricperturbation layer (Supplementary Fig., 1d). Compounds identi fied by MVA-DNF in combination with flu- vastatin induce apoptosis and block the SREBP2-regulatedfeedback loop of the MVA pathway Potentiation of fluvastatin-induced cell death was evaluated by first identifying a sub-lethal compound concentration (de fined here as having less than 20% cancer cell death activity alone) (SupplementaryFig., 2). After single-agent activity was assessed sensitivity to increasingfluvastatin exposure in combination with the identi fied sub-lethal concentration of the compounds was evaluated in two BC cell linemodels (HCC1937 and MDA-MB-231)., These models have differentialsensitivity to fluvastatin as a single agent 18. Fluvastatin-induced potentiation (lower IC 50) was observed when combined with selume- tinib nel finavir,  and honokiol (Supplementary Figs., 3 and 4). Mitox- antrone did not potentiate flu v a s t a t i ni ne i t h e rc e l ll i n ea n dt h e r e f o r e was not further investigated., To determine the nature of the anti-proliferative activity of the statin-compound combinations we eval-uated cell death by two independent assays ( fixed propidium iodide staining and PARP cleavage) with selumetinib, nel finavir,  or honokiol., Our data indicate that all three compounds at sub-lethal concentra-tions, potentiate statin-induced cell death (Fig., 2). Mechanistically statins induce a feedback response mediated by SREBP2 that has been shown to dampen cancer cell sensitivity to statin exposure., Moreover blocking the SREBP2-mediated feedback response with dipyridamole enhances statin-induced cancer celldeath 23, 25., We have shown that dipyridamole blocks the regulatory cleavage and therefore activation,  of SREBP2, decreasing mRNAexpression of SREBP2 target genes., As expected statin treatment inboth the MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cell lines induced the expressionof SREBP2 target genes INSIG1 , HMGCR,  and HMGCS1 after 16 hours of treatment, which was blocked by co-treatment with dipyridamole(Fig., 3a, Supplementary Fig. 5a). Similarly nel finavir and honokiol,  but not selumetinib, blocked the statin-induced expression of MVA path-way genes (Fig., 3a, Supplementary Fig. 5a). Because SREBP2 is syn- thesized as an inactive full-length precursor that is processed to its active,  mature, nuclear form upon proteolytic cleavage, we usedwestern blot analysis to assess the protein levels of both full-lengthprecursor and mature SREBP2., Nel finavir and honokiol but not selu- metinib, blocked fluvastatin-induced SREBP2 processing and cleavage,  similar to dipyridamole (Fig., 3b, c), which is consistent with inhibited SREBP2 transcriptional activity (Fig. 3a). This suggests that while selumetinib is a strong potentiator o f statin-induced cell death there is no evidence that selumetinib regulates SREBP2 activity suggestinganother mode of potentiation (Fig., 3, Supplementary Fig. 5a). Thus MVA-DNF successfully identi fied nel finavir and honokiol as potentia- tors of fluvastatin-induced cell death by blocking the SREBP2-mediated feedback response., Dipyridamole is approved as a platelet aggregation inhibitor. Therefore to investigate the anti-platelet activity of nel finavir and honokiol, we evaluated the ability of these compounds to blockthrombin receptor-activating protein 6 (TRAP-6)-induced plateletaggregation., Using whole blood obtained from healthy donors not onmedication aggregation induced by TRAP-6 was measured using aMultiplate Analyzer and compared to no inhibitor controls., Althoughaggregation was decreased by dipyridamole (DP) there was no effectof nel finavir (NFV) or honokiol (HNK) (Supplementary Fig., 5b). Statin-compound combinations are synergistic in a breast can- c e rc e l ll i n es c r e e n To investigate the broad applicability of nel finavir and honokiol as potentiators of fluvastatin, and examine the determinants of synergy, we further evaluated these statin-compound combinations acrossa large panel of 47 BC cell lines., A 5-day cytotoxicity assay (sulforho- damine B assay SRB) in a 6  10 dose matrix was used to assessfluvastatin-compound ef ficacy., As expected dipyridamole treatment resulted in a dose-dependent increase in fluvastatin area above the curve (AAC) value (Supplementary Fig., 6a). Similarly nel finavir and honokiol treatment also resulted in a dose-dependent increase in flu- vastatin AAC values (Supplementary Fig., 6a). Based on these data weevaluated statin-compound synergy using the Bliss Index modelderived using SynergyFinder 38across the panel of BC cell lines., Like the dose-dependent sensitivity data we observed that the trend in synergybetween fluvastatin-dipyridamole across the 47 BC cell lines was also seen with fluvastatin-nel finavir and fluvastatin-honokiol (Fig., 4a). Since we had previously identi fied that the basal subtype of BC cell lines are more sensitive to fluvastatin as a single agent 18, w ee v a l - uated whether basal BC cell lines were similarly more sensitive to the fluvastatin-compound combinations., Classifying the BC cell lines into basal HER2,  and luminal B subtypes39, we determined that the synergy of the fluvastatin-compound combinations is independent of subtype (Supplementary Fig., 6b). This suggests these statin-compound com-binations can be applied to multiple BC subtypes as therapeuticoptions., Overall the synergy pro fil e sa c r o s st h et h r e e fluvastatin- compound combinations were signi ficantly similar (Fluva-NFV vs Fluva-DP, R s=0 ., 5 5 , p-value = 7.1e-05; Fluva-HNK vs Fluva-DP, R s=0 . 6 2 , p-value = 5.5e-06; Fluva-NFV vs Fluva-HNK, R s=0 . 8 3 , p-value <2.2e-16) (Fig. 4a). To further interrogate the similarity between the statin- compound combinations we evaluated the correlation of the RNA-seq and reverse phase protein array (RPPA) pro files of the 47 BC cell lines40 with their synergy scores for each of the statin-compound combina- tions., These represent the transcriptomic and proteomic state asso-ciations with synergy for each combination, respectively., We thenevaluated the correlation between these associations across the dif-ferent combinations (Fluva-DP vs Fluva-NFV, Fluva-DP vs Fluva-HNK, Fluva-NFV vs Fluva-HNK) (Fig., 4b) and identi fied a high positive cor- relation between the combinations on the basis of similar tran-scriptomic associations (Fluva-NFV vs Fluva-DP, R s=0 ., 7 3 , p-value <2.2e-16; Fluva-HNK vs Fluva-DP, R s=0 . 7 7 , p-value <2.2e-16; Fluva-NFV vs Fluva-HNK, R s=0 . 8 7 , p-value <2.2e-16). This high positive correla- tion was also seen between these combinations using proteomic(RPPA) and synergy data (Supplementary Fig., 6c) suggesting thatsimilar pathways were associated with the synergistic response to thethree statin-compound combinations., To compare the overlap in pathways associated with sensitivity to fluvastatin alone and synergy between the fluvastatin-compound combinations, a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using the Hall-mark Gene Set Collection was performed 41., These results showed that enriched pathways were highly similar amongst fluvastatin alone and thefluvastatin-compound combinations with one of the highest scoring enriched pathways being epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Fig., 4c). Because of the low agreement amongst EMT gene sets (Supplementary Fig. 7a), we more thoroughly tested this finding by evaluating four additional EMT gene sets. Similar trends were observedbetween fluvastatin alone and the fluvastatin-compound combinations for each of the EMT gene sets (Supplementary Fig., 6d). As we andothers have published that mesenchymal-enriched cancer cell lines aremore sensitive to statin monotherapy 42, 43, these data suggest that flu- vastatin is the primary driver of response to these statin-compoundcombinations., This is consistent with fluvastatin inhibiting the MVA pathway triggering the SREBP2-mediated feedback response, which inturn is inhibited by the second compound (dipyridamole,  nel finavir, or honokiol) in these fluvastatin-compound combinations., The individual genes within each of the EMT gene sets were examined to identify a biomarker of the synergistic response to thestatin-compound combinations., As mentioned, within the EMT field, gene set signatures have low agreement (Supplementary Fig. 7a). AArticle https//doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33144-9 Nature Communications | (2022) 13, 6323 4 previously published binary classi fier of five EMT genes could predict increased sensitivity to statins across 631 cell lines representing mul-tiple cancer types 42.T h i s five-gene classi fier was tested to see if it could also predict synergy between the different fluvastatin-compound combinations., As expected the EMT classi fier could predict sensitivity tofluvastatin alone across the panel of BC cell lines (Supplementary Fig., 8a) but failed to predict synergy to the fluvastatin-compound combinations (Supplementary Fig. 8b). To further evaluate EMT, eachof the five genes were interrogated individually. Expressions of these genes were binarized based on z-score. Interestingly low geneexpression and protein levels of E-cadherin ( CDH1 ), a canonical epi- thelial state marker, not only predicted sensitivity to fluvastatin alone but also drug synergy across all three fluvastatin-compound combi- nations (Fig., 4d, e and Supplementary Fig. 8c). To validate this finding E-cadherin protein expression was probed for across a panel of nine BC cell lines and showed that synergy to the fluvastatin-compound com- binations is positively associated with low E-cadherin protein expres-sion in 8 out of the 9 BC cell lines (BT549, SW527,  CAL51,  HS578t, HCC1419,  MCF7,  CAMA-1,  and MDAMB361) (Fig., 4f and Supplemen- tary Fig. 7b).

Live cell imaging was also used to monitororganoid growth (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 9b). We screened four patient-derived BC organoids with fluvastatin and nel finavir (Fig. 5d).

To further validate these results and determine mechanism of statin potentiation we focused on the three MVA-DNF compounds(vemurafenib, clotrimazole and baccatin III) that potentiatedfluvastatin-induced cell death and interrogated these compounds for their ability to block the SREBP2-mediated feedback response., Wedeveloped a mNeon-SREBP2 cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation assayin a non-transformed mouse mammary gland epithelial cell line(NMuMG)., These cells were chosen as they have an intact sterolfeedback response and there is an established cell image referencelibrary of organelle markers (landmarks) that can be used to auto- matically assign the subcellular localization of mNeon-SREBP2 by image-based machine learning 44., As expected exposure of the cells to lipoprotein de ficient serum (LPDS) and either i) fluvastatin and ger- anylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), or ii) U18666A,  resulted in nucleartranslocation of mNeon-SREBP2., Fluvastatin inhibits HMGCR andGGPP blocks fluvastatin-induced cell death 45 while U18666A is an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis and transport (Fig., 6b and Supple- mentary Fig. 11a, b). To identify inhibitors of SREBP2 translocation we exposed the mNeon-SREBP2 NMuMG cells for 16 h with the agonists to driveSREBP2 activation ( fluvastatin/GGPP or U18666A in LPDS) and a con- centration range of positive control compounds that block the feed- back response 46(dipyridamole, nel finavir, honokiol) and PF429242 (site-1 protease inhibitor) as well as the additional MVA-DNF com-pound hits that potentiated statin-induced cell death (vemurafenib, clotrimazole and baccatin III)., The treated cells were imaged by con-focal microscopy and subcellular localization was assigned as eithernuclear or cytoplasmic using the classi fier associated with the orga- nelle reference library 44(Fig., 6b). As expected the positive controls dipyridamole and PF429242 blocked fluvastatin/GGPP induced mNeon-SREBP2 nuclear translocation 72% to 41% and 69% to <20%, respectively., Moreover mNeon-SREBP2 nuclear translocation was blocked by nel finavir (75% to <20%) and honokiol (68% to 30%) (Fig., 6b) consistent with the results presented above (Fig. 3b). Similar dose-dependent inhibition of nuclear translocation was evident whenU18666A was used as the translocation agonist (Supp Fig 11a, b), consistent with the translocation results seen by immunoblotting(Fig., 3b). Translocation of mNeon-SREBP2 was also blocked by vemurafenib (73% to 20%) and clotrimazole (73% to <20%), but not bybaccatin III (73% to 64%)., These data suggest that both vemurafeniband clotrimazole potentiate fluvastatin induced cell death by blocking the SREBP2-mediated feedback response, whereas baccatin IIIpotentiates fluvastatin via an alternative mechanism., Discussion Dipyridamole potentiates statin ef ficacy to drive tumor cell death by blocking the statin-induced restorative feedback response of the MVApathway 23, 25., Statins are readily available, safe, approved and manu- factured as inexpensive generic drugs. Our goal was to expand thenumber of agents that potentiate the pro-apoptotic activity of statinsto ultimately better use statins as anticancer agents at clinicallyachievable doses., Systematic and targeted efforts have been made inthe past to identify drugs that potentiate statins anticancer effects 4752., To this end we used a computational pharmacogenomics pipeline toenrich for compounds with similar properties to our prototypic com- pound, dipyridamole,  at the level of structure, anti-proliferative activity and MVA pathway gene expression perturbation., We identi-fied 19 potential compounds and evaluated several for their ability to potentiate statin-induced apoptosis by blocking the restorative feed-back loop of the MVA pathway., By this approach we first validatednelfinavir and honokiol from the prioritized hits by combining fluvas- tatin with each of these agents, whereby the concentration of fluvas- tatin needed to induce cell death was then lowered to a clinically-achievable range 53, 54., Analysis of basal RNA and protein expression identi fied the epithelial cell marker CDH1 (E-cadherin) as a biomarker of the synergistic response to both fluvastatin-nel finavir and fluvastatin-honokiol treatment., Fr om the remaining hits we identi fied another 2 compounds,  clotrimazole and vemurafenib, that potentiatefluvastatin-induced cell death and block SREBP2 activity., In addition to blocking statin-induced SREBP2 activity several other activities of dipyridamole have been described, including inhi-bition of phosphodiesterases 55, n u c l e o s i d et r a n s p o r t56and glucose uptake57., By restricting the gene perturbation layer of the pharmaco- genomics pipeline to MVA pathway genes our rationale was to bypassthese extraneous activities and focus our analysis on identifying drugs whose mechanisms centered on the MVA pathway., This highlights that the computational pharmacogenomics pipeline described here islikely tunable to drug-speci fic structural features, activities and sig- naling pathways., Indeed as the two pharmacogenomic data sets usedhere continue to increase in size, these additional drugs and genes canbe leveraged to further customize the analysis., Thefirst two statin-sensitizing agents identi fied using MVA-DNF include nel finavir and honokiol which we demonstrate here inhibit statin-induced SREBP2 cleavage and activation similar todipyridamole 23, 25., To date a number of agents have been identi fied that block SREBP2 activation, including fatostatin,  betulin,  and xanthohu- mal,  which block ER-Golgi translocation., Additional SREBP2 inhibitors include BF175 and tocotrienols that target SREBP2 transcriptionalactivity and protein stability, respectively., However other than nel fi- navir, these agents are either under development for clinical applica-tion or are only used for research purposes and are not likely to beadvanced to patient care., The S2P protease inhibitor nel finavir (mar- keted as Viracept) was approved for use in 1997 as an antiviral for thetreatment of HIV, and is under evaluation for its utility as an anticanceragent 5863., This further reinforces that the combination of statin- nelfinavir is immediately actionable and should be further evaluated at the clinical level without delay., We suggest the fluvastatin-nel finavir combination is preferred compared to other statins as distinct cyto- chrome P450 enzymes are used to process these agents, therebyreducing the potential for adverse drug-drug interactions 64., To our knowledge honokiol in combination with statins in the context of cancer has not been well investigated., Honokiol is a naturalproduct commonly used in traditional medicine and has a number ofreported mechanisms of action., Here we show that honokiol inhibitsSREBP2 translocation and induction of gene expression in combina-tion with fluvastatin., As honokiol and its derivatives are presently under investigation discovering this activity for honokiol can beincorporated into future analyses of structure-activity relationships of this agent., We also observed this fluvastatin-nel finavir and fluvastatin- honokiol synergistic response to the combination therapies acrossmultiple subtypes of BC., Previ ously we and others had identi fied the basal-like BC subtype as more sensitive to statins alone and identi fied a mesenchymal-enriched gene expression pro file as highly predictive of statin sensitivity 42, 65, 66., Here we have expanded the scope of statin treatment to encompass a wider spectrum of BCs when used as com-bination therapy., Moreover analyses of gene and protein expressiondata across a large collection of BC cell lines identi fied canonical epi- thelial cell marker CDH1 as predictive of synergy to all three statin- compound (dipyridamole, nel finavir or honokiol) combinations., We further showed that low CDH1 expression levels served as a biomarker of synergistic response in BC cell lines 67., Other groups have indepen- dently correlated E-cadherin expression with statin resistance andsuggested its use as a biomarker of statin sensitivity 67.T h i ss u g g e s t s further evaluation of CDH1 as a biomarker is warranted in addition toArticle https, //doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33144-9 Nature Communications | (2022) 13, 6323 9 previously published gene expression signatures for statin sensitivity48., To expand upon the 2D cell culture findings we screened four 3D primary BC patient-derived tumor organoids to evaluatefluvastatin-nel finavir activity, alone and in combination., All four patient-derived organoid models were synergistic to fluvastatin- nelfinavir. Synergy was observed at physiologically achievable 2345, 53concentrations of fluvastatin and low nanomolar concentrations of nelfinavir., To further validate the remaining MVA-DNF compounds we used two high-throughput screening assays to identify compounds thatcould first potentiate fluvastatin-induced cell death and second block the SREBP2 mediated feedback response., First we leveraged a live-cellimaging assay that integrates the r esults from three independent live- Article https, //doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33144-9 Nature Communications | (2022) 13, 6323 10 cell dyes to determine cell death., Second we developed a live-cell imaging assay to quantify SREBP2 cytoplasmic-to-nuclear transloca- tion., Using this approach we identi fied two additional SREBP2 inhi- bitors, clotrimazole and vemurafenib, as statin-sensitizers.Clotrimazole is a topical antifungal agent and vemurafenib is an oralV 6 0 0 EB R A Fi n h i b i t o r .T h em e c h a nism of both these compounds as SREBP2 inhibitors remains unclear and warrants further investigation., Additional compounds tested in this study include selumetinib baccatin III and mitoxantrone, the former two were observed to sen-sitize BC cells to statin-induced apoptosis, but the latter did not., Ourdata suggest that selumetinib and baccatin III function through aSREBP2-independent mechanism. Drugs that function through alter- native mechanisms of statin potentiation identi fied using our method were anticipated due to the selection criteria in the MVA-DNF pipeline., The identi fication of such compounds is potentially advantageous as some multiple myeloma and prostate cancer cell lines have beenshown to lack statin-induced SREBP2 activity 22, 23, 45., Future investiga- tion to assess the effectiveness of the drug combinations in ex-vivo andmurine models of primary tumor growth and metastasis is warranted.Testing of drug combinations using additional models can provideinsights that are currently lacking from testing drug combinationsin vitro., These include the tumor microenvironment and immune cellinteractions. The data presented here have important clinical implications for statins as anticancer agents. Despite encouraging results fromwindow-of-opportunity clinical trials in BC using statins as a single-agent, only a modest effect was observed with some but not allpatients 20, 21., Accordingly discovery of therapeutic combinations is necessary to achieve signi ficant clinical impact., Our study provides a strong preclinical rationale to warrant further investigation of thefluvastatin-nel finavir, fluvastatin-honokiol,  fluvastatin-clotrimazole andfluvastatin-vemurafenib combinations, as well as the utility of CDH1 as a biomarker of response., Since nel finavir and vemurafenib are poised for repurposing and statins have demonstrated antic- ancer activity in early-phase clinical trials 20, 21, 53, 6872, clinical studies to further evaluate the therapeutic bene fit of these combinations can proceed swiftly., We validated the pharmacogenomic pipeline usingbreast cancer as a model system however these statin-compoundtreatment options may also be effective for additional cancers inwhich the mevalonate pathway is contributing to disease., The avail-ability of these approved well-tolerated, oral drugs as well as simplemethods for assessing CDH1 expression could enable rapid transla- tion of these findings to improve cancer patient outcomes., Methods This study was performed in accordance with the University Health Network (UHN) Research Ethics Board protocols (14-8358)., MVA-speci fic Drug Network Fusion (MVA-DNF) We developed a computational pharmacogenomic pipeline (MVA- DNF) that facilitates the identi fication of compounds that block theSREBP mediated feedback response and potentiate fluvastatin- induced cell death, by elucidating drug-drug relationships speci fict o the mevalonate (MVA) pathway., This MVA-DNF pipeline extends onsome principles of our previously described drug network fusionalgorithm 29, by utilizing the similarity network fusion algorithm across three drug taxonomies., The MVA-DNF pipeline expands on coreprinciples which include evaluation of your reference compound at three levels, drug structure,  drug sensitivity, and drug perturbation.Drug structure annotations and drug perturbation signatures areobtained from the LINCS-L1000 dataset 30, and drug sensitivity sig- natures are obtained from the NCI-60 drug panel31., Drug structure annotations were converted into drug similarity matrices by calculat- ing tanimoto similarity measures73and extended connectivity fingerprints74across all compounds, as described29., We extracted cal- culated Z-scores from drug-dose response curves for the NCI-60 drugsensitivity pro files and computed Pearson correlation across these profiles to generate a drug similarity matrix based on sensitivity 31.W e used our PharmacoGx package (version 1.6.1) to compute drug per-turbation signatures for the L1000 dataset using a linear regressionmodel 75., The regression model adjusts for cell speci fic differences batch effects,  and experiment duration, to generate a signature for theeffect of drug concentration on the transcriptional state of a cell., Thisfacilitates the identi fication of gene expression which has been sig- nificantly perturbed due to drug treatment., These signatures indicate transcriptional changes that are induced by compounds on cancer celllines. We further re fined the drug perturbation pro files to a set of six MVA-pathway genes (Supplementary Fig 1a) that had been obtainedfrom the literature as well as repositories of pathway-speci ficg e n es e t s , including MSigDB 76, H u m a n C y c77, a n dK E G G78, 79., These gene sets include mevalonate pathway and superpathway of geranylger- anyldiphosphate biosynthesis I (via mevalonate) from the HumanCyc80, a n d Kegg Terpenoid Backbone Biosynthesis from KEGG78, 79.T h e filtered drug-induced gene perturbation signatures were subsequently used to generate a drug perturbation similarity matrix that elucidates drug-drug relationships based on common transcriptional changes across the six MVA-pathway genes., We calcu-lated the similarity between estimated standardized coef ficients of drug perturbation signatures using the Pearson correlation coef ficient., Finally we used the similarity network fusion algorithm 32to integrate the af finity matrices for drug structure, drug sensitivity,  and MVA- pathway speci fic drug perturbation pro files, to generate an MVA- pathway speci fic drug taxonomy (MVA-DNF) spanning 238 compounds., Identi fication of compounds We interrogated the MVA-DNF taxonomy using a variety of approaches to identify a set of candidate compounds., Using MVA-DNF similarity scores we first generated a ranking of all compounds closest to dipyridamole,  our reference input., We then conducted a permutationtest to assess the statistical relationship of each ranked drug againstdipyridamole., Brie fly, drug fusion networks were generated 999 timesFig. 6 | Cell death and SREBP2 translocation assays validate additional phar- macogenomic MVA-DNF compounds., a HCC1937 cells were treated with a con- centration range of MVA-DNF compounds with and without 4 Mfluvastatin for 72 h.

We assessed the regulation of gene expression for genes involved in the mevalonate pathway across all of the top-selected compounds, by analyzing the drug-induced tran- scriptional pro files (described above)., Using MVA-DNF similarity s c o r e s w ef u r t h e ra s s e s s e dt h ec o n t r i b u t i o no fe a c ho ft h ed r u gl a y e r s(structure, sensitivity and perturbation) towards the identi fication of these compounds., A radar plot was generated that compared the scorebetween DP and each of the compounds identi fied using the af finity matrices pertaining to the structure,  sensitivity,  and perturbation lay-ers., To further prioritize the hits candidate compounds were cate-gorized by clinical relevance and known mechanism of action.Compounds that were known toxins or carcinogens were excludedfrom the analysis (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Fig 1b)., The topfive hits were selected for initial validation. We interrogated whether using some of our top hits as the reference input would converge to the same set of drug hits within ourMVA-centric pipeline., We retest ed the MVA-DNF pipeline using the same set of 6 MVA genes and using each of nel finavir and honokiol as our prototype drugs in place of dipyridamole., MVA-DNF and permu-tation testing was conducted to identify candidate compounds thatrank closest to nel finavir or honokiol using p<0.05 and z-score < 1.8., Overlaps between candidate compound hits were computed using theUpsetR 82package in R. While our MVA-DNF is focused on an MVA-speci ficd r u gp e r t u r - bation layer composed of six genes, we additionally tested the robustness and stability of generating MVA-DNF using an increasingnumber of genes as part of our drug perturbation layer., We tested theoverall speed and progress of the MVA-DNF and permutation testingpipeline as a function of time spent processing the data (CPU time inseconds that the overall pipeline has taken) and computer memoryconsumed (in megabytes) when running the pipeline on different genesizes., We re-ran the MVA-DNF pipeline using a different number ofrandom genes in the drug perturbation layer (n = 6, 10,  100,  500,  900genes), and then running 999 random permutations of the MVA-DNFfor each of the designated gene sizes as part of the permutation testing pipeline., We computed the runtime for one complete run of the pipeline (ie 1000 runs of MVA-DNF) using the proc.time() function in R, and computed overall megabytes of RAM consumed using the mem_- used() function of the pryr package 83in R. For each of the gene sizes tested, we conducted 5 complete runs of the pipeline to assess overallperformance over multiple runs of MVA-DNF., Cell culture and compounds All cell lines were cultured as described previously18,25.

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR(qRT-PCR) was performed using the ABI Prism 7900HT sequencedetection system and TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems) for HMGCR (Hs00168352), HMGCS1 (Hs00266810),  INSIG1 (Hs01650979) and RPL13A (Hs01578913)., Anti-platelet analysis Whole blood was collected into 3.2% sodium citrate (Becton Dick- inson) at a ratio of 9, 1 (vol, vol) from healthy donors who providedwritten consent and were compensated financially (REB, Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board #4804)., Whole blood (300 L) was mixed with an equal volume of normal saline containing 3 mmol/LCaCl 2in the cup portion of a Multiplate test cell (Roche)., Dipyridamole (10M) nel finavir (10 M) or honokiol (10 M) or normal saline con- taining 3 mmol/L CaCl 2diluent (66 L) were added., After a three- minute incubation at 37 C platelet activation in whole blood wasinitiated by adding 32 mol/L thrombin receptor-activating protein 6 (TRAP-6) (Bachem, 4017752)., Electrical impedance was recorded for10 min using a Multiplate Analyzer (Roche). Values were expressed asaggregation, normalized to TRAP-6 alone in that donor. Drug combinations synergy analysis Viability scores were calculated using standard pipelines from Phar-macoGx R package 75, and synergy scores represented by Bliss Index were calculated using SynergyFinder R package38., Pearson correlation coefficient was used to measure the associations between the tran- scriptomic and proteomic states of cell lines and the corresponding synergy scores for each of the combinations., The transcriptomicassociations were then used to rank genes for GSEA 90.T h eH a l l m a r k gene set collection41was downloaded from MSigDB91.T h eP i a n oR package was used to run GSEA analysis92., Other EMT-related pathwaysnamely GO Positive Regulation of Epithelial To Mesenchymal Transition 93, GO Epithelial To Mesenchymal Transition 93, SARRIO Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition DN 94, a n d SARRIO Epithelial- Mesenchymal Transition Up 94, were also downloaded from MSigDB for analysis., Expressions of these genes were binarized based on z-score. Live cell imaging to interrogate additional MVA-DNF compounds HCC1937 cells were seeded at approximately 800 cells/well (16, 000 cells/mL) in a 384-well imaging plate (PerkinElmer Cell Carrier Ultra, 6057300)., Twenty-four hours later the cells were treated with indi-cated concentrations of the compounds or EtOH/DMSO (as a negativecontrol) either alone or in combination for 72 h. Thirty minutes prior toimaging, cells were co-stained with 5 M DRAQ5 (Biostatus,  DR51000),  10M TMRE (Life Technologies, T669) and 5 M IncuCyte Caspase-3/ 7 Dye for Apoptosis (Sartorius,  4440)., DRAQ5 staining was used toidentify and segment individual cells as well as to measure nuclearcondensation, TMRE was used to visualize loss of mitochondrialmembrane potential and IncuCyte Caspase-3/7 Dye detects activationof two caspases associated with ongoing apoptosis., Cells were imagedusing an Opera Phenix automated confocal microscope (PerkinElmer)with a 20x air objective., Three channels were captured (i) DRAQ5(excitation laser,  640 nm,  emission filter,  650 760 nm), (ii) TMRE (excitation laser,  561 nm,  emission filter, 570 630 nm) and iii) Caspase- 3/7 (excitation laser,  488 nm,  emission filter,  500 550)., It should be noted that the Caspase-3/7 staining in the well is not fully captured in the images shown because the change in morphology of the dying cellsresults in much of the signal not being in the same focal plane as themitochondria., Three technical replicates were performed for each ofthree independent experiments ( n= 3). Technical replicates were in separate wells and a minimum of five different fields of view were acquired for each well., Image acquisition calculation of intensity fea-tures for each channel, and image analysis were performed usingHarmony software (PerkinElmer)., Image sets were then subjected tolinear classi fication analysis (PhenoLOGIC TM)t od e t e r m i n e %D e a d  cells for each treatment condition., Training sets consisting of approximately twenty cells per population ( healthy ordead )w e r e generated and morphological properties and intensity values wereautomatically calculated for every cell., PhenoLOGIC TMwas then used to automatically select parameters that discriminate between growing  cells and dead cells and subsequently a value for %D e a d was calculated., SREBP2 translocation assay to interrogate MVA-DNF compounds To generate mNeon-SREBP2 fluorescent fusion protein, the coding region of the SREBF2 gene was ampli fied by PCR and cloned into the lentiviral vector pLVX-EF1a-mNeonGreen-IRES-Neomycin using NotI and SpeI restriction sites., To generate fluorescently-tagged RanGTP as a nuclear marker RanGTP was fused to mScarlet-I in pLVX-EF1a-mScarlet-I-IRES-Puromycin by using BamHI and SpeI., To express stablySREBP2 and RanGTP in NMuMG cells the lentiviral DNA plasmid andboth pPAX2 and pMD2.G plasmids were transfected intoHEK293T cells at 1, 1, 0.1 ratios by means of polyethylenimine (PEI).After 72 h, the virus-containing supernatant was collected from theHEK293T cells and filtered through a 0.45- mfilter unit and trans- ferred onto NMuMG cells., To obtain stable cell lines selection wasperformed by adding either by G418 (Wisent) or puromycin (Sigma)48 h after transduction., NMuMG cells co-expressing mNeon-SREBP2 and mScarlet-I- RanGTP were seeded (three wells per drug treatment) in a 384-wellmicroplate (CellCarrier-384 ultra, B128 SRI/160,  Perkin Elmer) andallowed to grow for 24 h. After drug treatment (16hrs), plates wereimaged (13 fields of view) on a spinning disk automated confocalArticle https, //doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33144-9 Nature Communications | (2022) 13, 6323 13 microscope (OPERA Phenix, PerkinElmer) with 40x water objective (NA = 0.9) in a de fined temperature (37 C) and CO 2(5%) environment., Images were collected using sCMOS cameras (4.6 MP, 16-bit), unbin-ned. Segmentation and feature extraction were carried out in Cell- Profiler software version 4.1.3. 95. As described in Schormann et al.44 subcellular localization was determined by classifying the cell images using a Random Forests algorithm., The algorithm automaticallyidenti fies the main subcellular localization of the target proteins in each cell., For simplicity here the subcellular localizations were reducedto nuclear or cytoplasmic. The cytoplasmic designation includeslocalization in the Endoplasmic reticulum secretory pathway andGolgi apparatus., Only cell image classi fications above 20% are con- sidered signi ficant and shown in the results. Classi fication experiments were carried out in three replicates. Organoid synergy assay Clear-bottom 384-well plates (Corning 3712) were coated with a 10%matrix (3, 1 ratio of Collagen I (PureCol Solution,  3 mg/mL,  AdvancedBiomatrix,  5005), Cultrex PathClear Reduced Growth Factor BME (Bio-Techne, 3533-010-02)) in breast organoid media 96., Organoids were dissociated and seeded as single cells (750 cells/well) into previouslyprepared plates in breast organoid media containing 2% BME andtreated the next day., To test the c ombinations in the panel of BC organoids the fluvastatin/nel finavir, drug combination was tested in a 6  6 dose matrix format covering a range of decreasing concentra-tions of each drug (the highest drug dose was 1.71 Mfluvastatin and 9.78Mn e l finavir), along with all pairwise combinations,  as well as the negative control (DMSO)., Organoids were treated using the automatedTecan drug dispenser and imaged using the IncuCyte an automatedlive-cell imaging assay., After 7 14 days of treatment cell death was measured using Cell Titre-Glo 3D assay (Promega, 9682) and readusing a CLARIOstar plate reader (BMG Labtech)., All individually trea-ted well values were normalized to the control well values. Dose-response matrices were then used to compute synergy scores usingSynergyFinder 38. All organoid models described in this study were generated from patient tissue obtained with informed consent andwith UHN institutional REB approval (#14-8358, #17-5518 and #06- 0196), the organoids were characterized and deposited with the Princess Margaret Living Biobank ( www.livingbiobank.ca )., No patient compensation was provided.

      "answer": "The abstract of the paper discusses the identification of drugs that enhance the anti-breast cancer effects of statins through a computational pharmacogenomic approach. Statins, known for their cholesterol-lowering properties, also exhibit anticancer activity, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The study highlights that dipyridamole can amplify statin-induced cancer cell death by inhibiting a feedback mechanism triggered by statin treatment. To discover additional compounds with similar effects, the researchers developed a pharmacogenomics pipeline focused on genes in the mevalonate pathway, termed mevalonate drug-network fusion (MVA-DNF). They validated several compounds, including nel finavir and honokiol, which were found to synergize with statins and block the feedback response associated with statin treatment. The study emphasizes the potential of these identified compounds to improve the efficacy of statins in cancer therapy, particularly for TNBC, and suggests that low expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin may serve as a predictive biomarker for treatment response."

      "question": "Describe the methodology used in the paper.",
      "answer": "The methodology used in the paper titled \"Computational pharmacogenomic screen identifies drugs that potentiate the anti-breast cancer activity of statins\" involves a computational pharmacogenomics pipeline named mevalonate drug-network fusion (MVA-DNF). This methodology is designed to identify compounds that can enhance the anticancer effects of statins by blocking the statin-induced restorative feedback response mediated by the SREBP2 transcription factor.\n\n### Key Steps in the Methodology:\n\n1. **Data Integration**: The MVA-DNF pipeline integrates three distinct data layers:\n   - **Drug Structure**: Similarity between drug structures is assessed using the Tanimoto index to create a drug structure affinity matrix.\n   - **Drug Sensitivity**: Drug sensitivity profiles are generated from the NCI-60 dataset, where the Pearson correlation coefficient is used to create a sensitivity affinity matrix.\n   - **Drug-Induced Gene Perturbation**: Gene expression changes induced by drug treatment are analyzed, focusing specifically on six mevalonate pathway genes (ACLY, ACAT2, HMGCS1, HMGCR, FDFT1, INSIG1). This results in a drug perturbation similarity matrix.\n\n2. **Compound Identification**: The integration of these three matrices is performed using similarity network fusion, which allows for the identification of compounds that are statistically significant in their similarity to dipyridamole (the reference compound). A permutation test is conducted to assess the statistical significance of the identified compounds, leading to the selection of 19 candidate compounds.\n\n3. **Validation of Compounds**: The top-ranked compounds, including nel finavir and honokiol, are validated through in vitro assays to assess their ability to potentiate fluvastatin-induced cell death. This involves:\n   - **Cell Line Models**: The compounds are tested in breast cancer cell lines (e.g., HCC1937 and MDA-MB-231) to evaluate their efficacy in combination with fluvastatin.\n   - **Mechanistic Studies**: The mechanism of action is investigated, particularly focusing on the ability of these compounds to block the SREBP2-mediated feedback response.\n\n4. **Synergy Analysis**: The study employs a Bliss Index model to analyze the synergy between fluvastatin and the identified compounds across a panel of 47 breast cancer cell lines. This analysis helps to determine the effectiveness of the drug combinations.\n\n5. **3D Organoid Assays**: To further validate the findings, the researchers develop patient-derived breast cancer organoids and assess the efficacy of the fluvastatin-nel finavir combination in a 3D culture system.\n\n6. **Biomarker Identification**: The expression levels of E-cadherin (CDH1) are analyzed as a potential biomarker for predicting the synergistic response to the drug combinations.\n\n7. **Statistical Analysis**: Various statistical methods, including one-way ANOVA and Pearson correlation coefficients, are used to analyze the data and establish the significance of the findings.\n\nThis comprehensive methodology combines computational and experimental approaches to identify and validate compounds that can enhance the anticancer effects of statins, providing a pathway for potential therapeutic strategies in breast cancer treatment."

Notable compounds validated include nel finavir and honokiol.\n\n2. **Mechanism of Action**: The identified compounds were found to potentiate statin-induced cancer cell death by blocking the SREBP2-mediated restorative feedback response triggered by statin treatment. This feedback loop typically reduces the pro-apoptotic activity of statins.\n\n3. **Predictive Biomarker**: Low expression of E-cadherin (CDH1), a canonical epithelial cell marker, was identified as a predictive biomarker for the synergy between statins and the identified compounds. This suggests that E-cadherin levels could help predict which patients might benefit from these combination therapies.\n\n4. **Additional Validated Compounds**: Beyond nel finavir and honokiol, the study also validated clotrimazole and vemurafenib as compounds that enhance fluvastatin-induced cell death by inhibiting the SREBP2 feedback response.\n\n5. **Broad Applicability**: The synergistic effects of the statin-compound combinations were observed across various breast cancer cell lines, indicating potential utility across different breast cancer subtypes, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is known for its aggressive nature and poor prognosis.\n\n6. **Clinical Implications**: The findings support the potential for repurposing existing FDA-approved drugs (like nel finavir and vemurafenib) in combination with statins for breast cancer treatment, emphasizing the need for further clinical evaluation of these combinations.\n\n7. **Computational Approach**: The study highlights the effectiveness of the computational pharmacogenomics approach in identifying actionable compounds that can enhance the efficacy of existing cancer therapies, paving the way for future drug discovery efforts targeting specific metabolic pathways in cancer.\n\nOverall, the research provides a promising strategy for enhancing the anticancer activity of statins through combination therapies, with implications for improving treatment outcomes in breast cancer patients."

      "question": "Was the data in the study pre-processed in anyway? If so how?",
      "answer": "Yes, the data in the study was pre-processed in several ways. The authors developed a computational pharmacogenomics pipeline called Mevalonate Drug Network Fusion (MVA-DNF) to identify compounds that potentiate the anti-cancer activity of statins. Here are the key steps involved in the pre-processing of the data:\n\n1. **Data Extraction**: The study utilized two primary datasets: the LINCS-L1000 dataset and the NCI-60 drug sensitivity dataset. From these datasets, the authors extracted drug structure information, drug-cell line sensitivity profiles, and drug-induced gene perturbation data for 238 compounds that were common to both datasets.\n\n2. **Gene Perturbation Layer Restriction**: The authors restricted the drug-gene perturbation layer of the L1000 dataset to include only six specific genes associated with the mevalonate pathway (ACLY, ACAT2, HMGCS1, HMGCR, FDFT1, and INSIG1). This pathway-centric approach was aimed at enriching the selection of candidate compounds that specifically target the mevalonate pathway.\n\n3. **Affinity Matrix Generation**: For each data layer (drug structure, drug sensitivity, and gene perturbation), the authors generated a 238 x 238 drug affinity matrix. This involved:\n   - Computing the similarity between pairs of drug structures using the Tanimoto index.\n   - Calculating the similarity for drug sensitivity profiles using the Pearson correlation coefficient.\n   - Creating an affinity matrix for the MVA-specific perturbation layer by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient on the filtered drug perturbation signatures.\n\n4. **Integration of Data Layers**: The three affinity matrices were integrated using a similarity network fusion algorithm, which allowed the authors to identify compounds that were statistically significant in relation to the reference compound, dipyridamole.\n\n5. **Statistical Filtering**: The authors performed permutation testing to filter the identified compounds, ultimately selecting those with a permutation test p-value < 0.05 and a z-score < 1.8.\n\nThese pre-processing steps were crucial for identifying compounds that could synergize with statins by blocking the SREBP2-mediated feedback response in the mevalonate pathway, thereby enhancing the anti-cancer effects of statins."

      "question": "Can you provide a summary of the literature review from the paper?",
      "answer": "The literature review in the paper discusses the role of statins, a class of FDA-approved cholesterol-lowering drugs, in cancer treatment, particularly breast cancer. It highlights that statins inhibit the mevalonate (MVA) metabolic pathway, which is often dysregulated in various cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The review cites epidemiological studies indicating that statin use is associated with reduced cancer incidence and recurrence, particularly in breast cancer, where users show a significant reduction in recurrence rates.\n\nThe review also emphasizes the challenges in treating TNBC due to its aggressive nature and the limited understanding of its biology, which necessitates the development of novel therapeutic strategies. It points out that traditional chemotherapy regimens remain the primary treatment option, underscoring the urgent need for effective alternatives.\n\nFurthermore, the literature review discusses the mechanisms by which statins induce apoptosis in cancer cells, particularly in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cell lines. It notes that while clinical trials have shown promise for statins in reducing tumor cell proliferation and increasing apoptosis, there is still a gap in understanding how to optimize their use as anticancer agents. The review suggests that combining statins with other compounds could enhance their efficacy by overcoming resistance mechanisms.\n\nThe review concludes by discussing the potential of targeting the MVA pathway as a therapeutic strategy and the importance of identifying compounds that can synergize with statins to improve their anticancer effects. This sets the stage for the authors' computational pharmacogenomics approach to identify additional compounds that can enhance the anticancer activity of statins."

They highlight that since nel finavir and vemurafenib are already approved for other uses, clinical trials can be expedited.\n\n2. **Exploration of CDH1 as a Biomarker**: The study identifies CDH1 (E-cadherin) expression as a potential biomarker for predicting the synergistic response to statin-compound combinations. Future research should focus on validating CDH1 as a biomarker in clinical settings.\n\n3. **Investigation of Additional Cancers**: The authors suggest that the pharmacogenomic pipeline developed in this study could be applied to other cancers where the mevalonate pathway plays a significant role. This could lead to the discovery of new therapeutic combinations for various cancer types.\n\n4. **Ex-Vivo and Murine Models**: They recommend testing the effectiveness of the drug combinations in ex-vivo and murine models of primary tumor growth and metastasis to gain insights into the tumor microenvironment and immune cell interactions, which are not fully captured in in vitro studies.\n\n5. **Further Characterization of Mechanisms**: The authors note that while some compounds were identified as SREBP2 inhibitors, the exact mechanisms of action for others, such as clotrimazole and vemurafenib, remain unclear. Future studies should investigate these mechanisms to better understand how these compounds potentiate statin-induced apoptosis.\n\nOverall, the authors advocate for a comprehensive approach that includes clinical validation, biomarker exploration, and broader applicability of their findings across different cancer types."

The key statistical methods mentioned in the paper include:\n\n1. **Permutation Testing**: This technique was employed to assess the statistical significance of compounds similar to dipyridamole by comparing them to 999 networks generated from random selections of six genes within the drug perturbation layer. This approach helps to determine if the observed results are statistically significant or could have occurred by chance.\n\n2. **Statistical Significance Assessment**: The paper reports that compounds were considered statistically significant if they had a p-value of less than 0.05. This threshold was used to filter the results from the MVA-DNF analysis.\n\n3. **Pearson Correlation Coefficient**: This statistical measure was used to compute the similarity between drug sensitivity profiles and drug perturbation signatures, allowing the researchers to create affinity matrices that reflect the relationships between different compounds based on their effects on cancer cell lines.\n\n4. **Radar Plot Analysis**: The contribution of different data layers (drug structure, perturbation, and sensitivity) to the overall score of each compound was visualized using radar plots, which help in understanding the relative importance of each layer in identifying effective compounds.\n\n5. **Bliss Index Model**: This model was used to evaluate the synergy between drug combinations (e.g., fluvastatin with other compounds) across a large panel of breast cancer cell lines. The Bliss Independence model is a common method for assessing drug interaction effects.\n\n6. **Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)**: This statistical method was applied to identify enriched pathways associated with the sensitivity to fluvastatin alone and in combination with other compounds, helping to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying the observed effects.\n\nThese statistical techniques collectively contributed to the validation of the computational pharmacogenomics approach and the identification of compounds that potentiate the anti-cancer activity of statins."
