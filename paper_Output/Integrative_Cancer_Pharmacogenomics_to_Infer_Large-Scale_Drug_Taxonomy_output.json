Introduction Continuous growth and ongoing deployment of large-scale pharmacogenomic datasets has opened new avenues of research for the prediction of biochemical interactions of small molecules with their respective targets and therapeutic effects, also referred to as drug mechanisms of action (MoA)., Development of compu- tational methods to predict MoA of new compounds is an active field of research in the past decade (1)., Despite major advance-ments in this field key challenges still remain in the (i) design of classi fication approaches that rely on minimal drug characteristics to classify drugs, and (ii) selection and integration of comple- mentary datasets to best characterize drugs' effects on biological systems., The notion of a \"minimalist\" approach to represent similar- ities among drug compounds has been extensively explored, with varying results., Several computational strategies have solely relied on chemical structure similarity to infer drug  target interactions (2, 3),  based on the assumption that struc- turally similar drugs share similar targets, and ultimately,  similar pharmacologic and biological activity (4)., However sole dependence on chemical structure information fails to consider drug-induced genomic and phenotypic perturbations, which directly connect with biological pathways and molecular disease mechanisms (5,  6)., Seminal approaches by Iorio and colleagues (7) and Iskar and colleagues (8) leveraged drug- induced transcriptional pro files from Connectivity Map (CMAP, ref., 9) toward identi fication of drug drug similarities and MoA solely based on gene expression pro files (7)., The major limitation of CMAP however,  is the lack of global scope,  as only 1, 309 drugs are characterized across 5 cancer cell lines (9)., Other methods have integr ated prior knowledge such as adverse effects annotations (10 11), and recent approaches showed that integrating multiple layers of information had improved Anatomical Therapeutic Classi fication System (ATC) prediction for FDA-approved drugs (12)., While these initiatives constitutes major advances toward characterizing drug MoA comparing the consistency of suc h efforts towards prediction of new, uncharacterized small molecules remains a challenge.1Integrative Computational Systems Biology, Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montr /C19eal,  Montreal,  Quebec, Canada.2Department of Biomedical Sciences., Universit /C19e de Montr /C19eal Montreal,  Quebec,  Canada.3Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network,  Toronto,  Ontario,  Canada.4Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto,  Toronto,  Ontario,  Canada.5Depart- ment of Computer Science, University of Toronto,  Toronto,  Ontario,  Canada., 6School of Computer Science McGill University,  Montreal,  Quebec,  Canada.7The Donnelly Centre, Toronto,  Ontario,  Canada.8The Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute,  Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto,  Ontario,  Canada.9Hospital for Sick Children,  Toronto,  Ontario, Canada.10Ontario Institute of Cancer Research,  Toronto,  Ontario,  Canada., Note Supplementary data for this article are available at Cancer Research Online (http, //cancerres.aacrjournals.org/)., N.

We demonstrate how the resulting integrative drug taxonomies improve characterization of drug target and anatomic classi fications compared with taxonomies based on single data types., Importantly we show how the DNF taxonomy can be used to infer MoA for new compounds that lack deep phar macologic and biochemical characterization., Materials and Methods A schematic overview of the analysis design is presented in Supplementary Fig. S1. Processing of drug-related data and identi fication of drug similarity Cancer cell lines. We refer to the original publications of the NCI60 (16) CTRPv2 (14), and L1000 (17) datasets for the source,  number of passages, and authentication of the cancer cell lines used in this study., Drug structure annotations. Canonical SMILES strings for the small molecules were extracted from PubChem (18) a databaseof more than 60 million unique structures., Tanimoto similarity measures (19) between drugs were calculated by first parsing annotated SMILES strings for existing drugs through the parse., smiles function of the rcdk package (version 3.3.2). Extended connectivity fingerprints (hash-based fingerprints default length 1, 024) across all drugs was subsequently calculated using the rcdk, , get., fingerprints function (20). Drug perturbation signatures. We obtained transcriptional pro files of cancer lines treated with drugs from the L1000 dataset recently released by the Broad Institute, which contains over 1.8 million gene expression pro files of 1000 \"landmark\" genes across 20, 413 drugs., We used our PharmacoGx package (version 1.3.4; ref. 21) to compute signatures for the effect of drug concentration on the transcriptional state of a cell, using a linear regression model adjusted for treatment duration,  cell line identity, and batch to identify the genes whose expression is signi ficantly perturbed by drug treatment, G14b0biCibtTbdDbbB,  where G14molecular feature expression (gene)., Ci14concentration of the compound applied.

The transcriptional changes induced by drugs on cancer cell lines are subsequently referred to throughout the text as drug perturbation signatures., Similarity between estimated coef ficients of drug perturbation signatures was computed using the Pearson corre- lation coef ficient, with the assumption that drugs similarly per- turbing the same set of genes might have similar mechanisms of action., Drug sensitivity pro files.We obtained summarized dose response curves from the published drug sensitivity data of the NCI60 (13) and CTRPv2 (14) datasets integrated in the PharmacoGx package., We relied on the Z-score and area under the curve (AUC d) metrics from drug dose response curves of the NCI60 and CTRPv2, respectively., Drug similarity was de fined as the Pearson correla- tion of drug sensitivity pro files. Development of a DNF taxonomy We used our Similarity Network Fusion algorithm (15) to identify drugs that have similar mechanisms of actions by integrating three data types representing drug structure, drug perturbation,  and drug sensitivity pro files., Drug structure and drug perturbation taxonomies were based on drug drug sim- ilarity matrices computed from the PubChem SMILES and the L1000 dataset, respectively., To test the robustness of the fusion algorithm with respect to the scale of the drug sensitivity profiles, we also applied our methodology on both the CTRPv2 and NCI60 datasets., The NCI60 dataset comprises a much smaller panel of cell lines (60 vs. 860 for NCI60 and CTRPv2 respectively)., The NCI60 panel compensates for its small cell line panel by the large number of screened drugs (>40, 000 drugs tested on the full panel,  Supplementary Fig., S2). Accordingly the drug sensitivity taxonomy was composed of the drug drug similarity matrix of the sensitivity pro filesEl-Hachem et al., Cancer Res 77(11) June 1,  2017 Cancer Research 3058Downloaded from http, //aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/77/11/3057/2749991/3057.pdf by University Health Network user on 20 November 2023 extracted from either the NCI60 or CTRPv2 datasets., For each dataset an af finity matrix was first calculated using the affini- tyMatrix function as described in the SNFtool package (version 2.2), using default parameters., We combined the three af finity matrices of the structure perturbation, and sensitivity taxo- nomies into a DNF matrix using the SNFtool, , SNF function (Supplementary Fig., S1). Two separate DNF matrices were generated dependant on the sensitivity layer used (either CTRPv2 or NCI60)., The developed DNF taxonomies as well as the single data type taxonomies, were subsequently tested against benchmark datasets to validate their drug MoA.Assessment of drug mode of action across drug taxonomies Drug target associations., Known target associations for drugs pertaining to the NCI60 dataset were downloaded from Drug- Bank (version 5.0, ref., 22). Drug target associations for drugs of the CTRPv2 dataset were obtained from the CTRPv2 website (http, //www.broadinstitute.org/ctrp.v2/?page 14#ctd2Target)., Drugs with annotated targets were filtered to retain only targets with at least two drugs.

These ATC codes were filtered to retain only those categories with at least one pair of drugs sharing a pharmacologic indi- cation., The drugs with known ATC annotations from the NCI60 and CTRPv2 datasets were subsequently used as a validation benchmark against singular drug taxonomies and the DNF taxonomy., Evaluation of drug mechanism of action across taxonomies. We assessed the predictive value of our developed taxonomies against drug target and ATC benchmark datasets to determine the extent to which single data type taxonomies and the DNF taxonomy recapitulate known drug MoA (Supplementary Fig., S3). We adapted the method from Cheng and colleagues (25) to compare benchmarked datasets against singular drug taxo- nomies (drug perturbation, drug structure,  or drug sensitivity) as well as the integrated DNF taxonomy., This method is further detailed below for the benchmark datasets used in our study. First we created adjacency matrices that indicate whether each pair of drugs share a target molecule or ATC annotation., The drug-target and ATC adjacency matrices were then converted into a vector of similarities between every possible pair of drugs where the value \"1\" was assigned in the vector if the paired drugs were observed the same target/ATC set, and \"0\" other- wise., Similarly the af finity matrices of singular drug taxo- nomies as well as the DNF taxonomy matrix were converted into vectors of drug pairs, with the similarity value of the drug pairs retained from their origin al corresponding matrix., Binary vectors of the benchmarks were compared with the four con- tinuous vectors of the drug taxonomies by computing the ROC and the area under the curve (AUROC) using the ROCR package (version 1.0.7)., Concordance indices were calculated using the rcorr.cens function of the Hmisc package (version 1.18.0)., The AUROC estimates the probability that for two pairs of drugs, drugs that are part of the same drug set (same therapeutic targets or ATC functional annotations) have higher similarity than drugs that do not belong to the same drug set., AUROC calculations for each of the four taxonomies were statistically compared against each other using the survcomp, , compare.cindex function (26)., Precision-Recall (PR) curve is an alternative to ROC curves for measuring an algorithm's performance, espe- cially in classi fication problems with highly skewed class dis- tributions., We used the PRROC package (version 1.1) to compute PR curves. This package does not implement functions for statistical comparison of PR curves. For these types of classi fication tasks algorithms that optimize AUROC do not necessarily optimize the area under the PR curves (AUPRC)., Therefore computing both curves brings more insight to mea- suring performance and comparin g multiple algorithms for the same prediction task., Detection of drug communities and visualization Clusters of drug communities were determined from the DNF taxonomy using the af finity propagation algorithm (APC) from the apcluster package (version 1.4.2)., The APC algorithm generates nonredundant drug communities with each com- munity represented by an exemplar drug., An elevated qvalue parameter which determines the quantiles of similarities to be used as input preference to generate small or large number of clusters, was set at q140.9 within the apcluster function to produce a large number of communities., Networks ofexemplar drugs were rendered in Cytoscape (version 3.3.0; ref. 27). Drug structures were rendered using the chemViz plugin (version 1.0.3) for cytoscape. A minimal spanning tree of the exemplar drugs was determined using Kruskal's algo- r i t h ma sp a r to ft h e CySpanningTree plugin (version 1.1) for cytoscape., Assessment of drug community enrichment We tested for the enrichment of drug communities determined from the DNF taxonomy against all drugs attributed to a speci fic target or ATC class., We first generated lists of drug targets and ATC classes from our benchmarks filtered to retain only drug targets or ATC classes with two or more drugs., Each of the 53 and 52 communities from the DNF taxonomy (using CTRPv2 and NCI60 drug sensitivity data, respectively) was subsequently compared against the lists using a Fisher exact test, followed by multiple testing (FDR) correction., DNF web application We developed the DNF web application (dnf.pmgenomics.ca) to facilitate the exploration of the drug communities and the full drug similarity networks built using the CTRPv2 and NCI60 drug sensitivity datasets., The application was implemented using Java- Script and AngularJS for its frontend and Node.js for its backend., Drug network information is stored on the server as JSON and rendered as graphs with the Cytoscape.js library (28)., As drug clusters are fully connected showing all edges in the web appli- cation will overwhelm the browser., Thus the graphs shown in the web application are thresholded to display the top 1, 000 edges between drugs that have the greatest similarity., Users can click on drug communities to display the full set of drugs and their similarity edges. Clicking on an edge reports the similarity score and its relative contribution to the fused similarity score., Clicking on drugs provides basic descriptors of the compound and its PubChem link.

Results We developed the DNF approach to generate a large-scale molecular taxonomy by integrating drug similarity matrices from structural information, transcriptomic perturbation,  and sensitiv- ity pro files (Supplementary Fig., S1). Drug structure pro files (SMILES representations) were extracted from the PubChem database. Drug perturbation signatures representing drug- induced gene expression changes, were extracted from the recent LINCS L1000 dataset., Drug sensitivity pro files representing cellEl-Hachem et al. Cancer Res 77(11) June 1,  2017 Cancer Research 3060Downloaded from http, //aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/77/11/3057/2749991/3057.pdf by University Health Network user on 20 November 2023 line viability across cancer cell lines were extracted from our PharmacoGx platform (21), whi ch contains pharmacologic profiles of several hundred cell l ines generated by the CTRP (14) and NCI60 (13) initiatives., By integrating these three data types we have generated a similarity network composed of over 200 drugs (Supplementary Fig., S2). The drug similarity matri- ces computed from single data layers and fusion estimates are provided in Supplementary Table S1 for the CTRPv2 and NCI60 taxonomies., To assess the relevance and bene fits of our integrative drug taxonomies we first tested whether the different data layers were redundant or complementary., We then tested whether DNF enables prediction of drug MoA. While de finitions may vary in the literature for the context of this study, we refer to drug mechanisms of action speci fically as determining drug targets for query drugs, as well as identi fication of the ATC for different drugs., We further tested whether DNF enables clustering of drugs sharing common action mechanisms and we demonstrated how identi- fied drug communities from this clustering may be used toward novel discoveries for drug repositioning approaches and clinical applications., Complementarity of drug structure perturbation, and sensitivity pro files We investigated the potential complementarity between drug structure, perturbation, and sensitivity pro files to assess their potential for drug taxonomies as part of DNF., We generated similarity networks (similarity matrices) representing each of the single-layer drug taxonomies of drug structure, drug pertur- bation,  and drug sensitivity (Supplementary Table S1)., In brief, we used the Tanimoto index to calculate the similarity between two drug structures. We used Pearson correlation to quantify the extent to which pairs of drugs affect similar genes at the expression level or whether drugs kill the same cancer cell lines for drug perturbation and drug sensitivity similarity matrices, respectively., We then computed the correlation between all pairs of similarity matrices (Supplementary Fig. S4) using the Spearman correlation. The single layers are only weakly corre- lated with a maximum absolute Spearman correlation coef fi- cient of 0.091 between the perturbation and sensitivity layers using the CTRPv2 sensitivity dataset (Supplementary Fig., S4A) as well as a maximum of 0.085 between the structure and sensitivity layers using the NCI60 sensitivity dataset (Supple- mentary Fig., S4B). In contrast the integrative drug taxonomy (DNF) is more highly correlated to each of the single layers, across both CTRPv2 (Supplementary Fig., S4A) and NCI60 (Supplementary Fig. S4B). These findings highlight that the structural sensitivity, and transcriptional perturbation data are nonredundant, thereby presenting a diversity of drug drug relationships across the set of drugs that commonly share all three data types., These findings also highlight that the DNF network yielded increased correlation between the three data types, such that it is not driven by only a single layer., Performance of drug taxonomies against known drug targets Determining novel drug target interactions opens new ave- nues for drug repurposing efforts, and suggests mechanisms by which drugs can operate in cells., We explored the relevance of our DNF taxonomy by demonstrating its predictive value towards identi fication of drug targets., Of the 239 drugs repre-sented in our DNF taxonomy generated using CTRPv2 141 could be matched against the drug target benchmarks (Sup- plementary Fig., S2). Similarity for the DNF taxonomy gener- ated using the NCI60 dataset, 86 drugs of 238 drugs could be matched to known drug target (Supplementary Fig., S2). We assessed the predictive value of our single-data layer and integrative drug taxonomies (DNF) against known drug targets (Supplementary Fig., S3). We performed a ROC analysis to quantify how well our drug taxonomies align with established drug target, by statistically comparing the AUROC values for each drug taxonomy under evaluation., Similarly, we calcu- lated the AUPRC (see Materials and Methods). Of the three single-layer taxonomies validated against annotated drug tar- gets from CTRPv2 the drug sensitivity layer outperformed the structure and perturbation taxonomies (AUROC of 0.83, 0.71,  and 0.64 for sensitivity,  structural,  and perturbation data layers, r e s p e c t i v e l y , F i g .2 A ) .I m p o r t a n t l y , D N Fy i e l d e dt h eb e s tp r e - dictive value (AUROC 140.89), and was signi ficantly higher than any single-layer taxonomy (one-sided Student ttest P< 1E16, Supplementary Table S2)., We further computed PR c u r v e s( F i g .2 B ) .T h e s ec u r v e sd e monstrate that DNF supersedes the single layers taxonomies except for sensitivity, where it performs equivalently (AUPRC of 0.413 and 0.406 for DNF and drug sensitivity, respectively,  Fig., 2B). We further tested the predictive value of our DNF taxonomy u s i n gt h es e to fd r u gs e n s i t i v i t yp r o files obtained from the NCI60 dataset, where a much smaller panel of cell lines has been screened (60 vs. 860 cell lines for NCI60 and CTRPv2, respectively,  Supplementary Fig., S2). Our evaluation of single- layer taxonomies demonstrates that drug similarities based on structure and sensitivity pro files were the most ef ficient in predicting drug target associations (AUROC of 0.8 for both layers, Supplementary Fig., S5A) compared with pertur- bation (AUROC of 0.62; Supplementary Fig. S5A). DNF was signi ficantly more predictive of drug target associations compared with single-layer taxonomies (AUROC of 0.88 and one-sided Student ttest Pvalues <0.05, Supplementary Fig., S5A, Supplementary Table S2 and AUPRC of 0.552; Supple- mentary Fig. S5B). Performance of drug taxonomies against anatomical classi fication Predicting the ATC of a drug provides insights about its phar- macologic mechanism, and ultimately presents new potential indications for previously uncharacterized drugs., We demonstrat- ed the relevance of our DNF network by testing its predictive value for ATC drug classi fications (Fig., 2; Supplementary Fig. S5). We explored the value of the DNF taxonomies towards classifying drugs up to ATC level 4 which reports the chemical,  therapeutic,  and pharmacologic subgroup of a given drug (23)., A total of 51 and 72 drugs could be matched against the ATC benchmarks for the CTRPv2 and NCI60 taxonomies, respectively., We implemen- ted a similar benchmarking approach to that previously con- ducted for drug target classi fication., We observed that drug sensitivity was no longer the most predictive layer for ATC classi fication and instead exhibited comparable predictive power to drug perturbation (Fig., 2C; Supplementary Fig. S5C). Con- versely, the structure-based taxonomy (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. S5C) was the most predictive among single-layer taxonomies (AUROC of 0.72 0.6, and 0.58 for structure,  sensitivity,  and perturbation layers,  respectively, for the CTRPv2 taxonomy, Integrative Drug Taxonomy Using Pharmacogenomics www.aacrjournals.org Cancer Res,  77(11) June 1, 2017 3061Downloaded from http, //aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/77/11/3057/2749991/3057.pdf by University Health Network user on 20 November 2023 see Supplementary Fig., S5 for the NCI60 taxonomy). DNF sig- nificantly outperformed single-layer taxonomies (Fig. 2C and D; Supplementary Fig. S5C and S5D AUROC of 0.8 and 0.85 for DNF based on CTRPv2 and NCI60,  respectively, with one-sided Student ttestP<0.05,  Supplementary Table S2, and AUPRC of 0.558 and 0.492 vs. random classi fiers' AUPRCs of 0.212 and 0.095,  respectively)., Identi fication of drug communities We assessed the biological relevance of DNF in discovering drugs with similar MoA by applying the af finity cluster prop- agation algorithm (30) to identify clusters of highly similar drugs, referred to as drug communities., These communities can be represented by their most representative (\"exemplar\") drug and similarities between communities are subsequently repre- sented a network where each node is labeled by the exemplar drug., Community detection was implemented on the full set of 239 and 238 drugs of the DNF taxonomy (based on using CTRPv2 and NCI60 sensitivity data, Fig., 3 and Supplementary Fig. S6 respectively). We identi fied 53 communities in the CTRPv2 DNF (Supple- mentary Table S3A) which resulted in a set of 39 drug commu- nities with at least 2 drugs with known drug targets (permutation test P<1E4, Supplementary Table S3B)., Overall DNF has produced a consistent classi fication of drugs for a variety of knownfunctional classes (Supplementary Table S3C)., Our classi fications recapitulate most of the protein target drug associations repre- sented in CTRPv2 (Fig., 3). Receptor tyrosine kinases and non- receptor tyrosine kinases including EGFR/ERBB2 (community C2), MEK1/2 (C41),  TGFRB1 (C39),  BRAF (C18),  and IGFR-1 (C6) KDR/FLT1 (C50) inhibitors., In addition to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors (C28) epigenetic regulators, HDACs (C45) and DNMT1 (C20) inhibitors, HMG CoA (C30) and proteasome inhibitors (C7) (Supplementary Table S3A and S3D)., Notably all BRAF (V600E mutation) inhibitors were classi fied correctly, which include drugs already tested in metastatic melanoma (community C18,  dabrafenib,  GDC0879, PLX4720,  Fig., 3) and MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors (C41: namely trametinib and selumetinib; Fig. 3). BRAF regulates the highly conserved MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and BRAF mutational status has been proposed as a biomarker of sensitivity towards selumetinib and other MEK inhibitors (31)., This explains the tight connection of these two communities (Fig. 3). Using the NCI60 DNF, we identi fied 51 communities (Sup- plementary Fig. S6 Supplementary Table S3E) with 20 of those containing at least two known drug targets (permutation test P <1E4, Supplementary Table S3F)., In this case, we also iden- tified a number of well-characterized drug communities. These include the community compos ed of EGFR inhibitors (C20; Supplementary Fig. S6).

Bisacodyl, a laxative drug, is part of the C14 community, which concurs with Khan and colleagues. who demonstrated a sharing a MoA similar to cardiac glycosides despite its struc- tural dissimilarity to that class of compounds (5)., Enrichment of DNF drug communities for drug targets and ATC classi fications We conducted a quantitative c ommunity enrichment anal- ysis to test whether DNF succeeds in identifying drug commu- nities that are enriched for drug targets and ATC classi fications., Fisher exact test was conducted between all the drugs in each community versus all drugs attributed to a speci ficd r u gt a r g e t or ATC class., This approach allowed us to test which speci fic drug targets or ATC classi fications are signi ficantly enriched in the computed communities (Fig., 4; Supplementary Fig. S7). The analysis was conducted u sing all of the communities ofDNF based on CTRPv2 ( n145 3c o m m u n i t i e s , F i g .4 , S u p p l e - mentary Table S4A and S4B) as well as DNF based on NCI60 sensitivity data ( n1451 communities, Supplementary Fig., S7; Supplementary Table S4C and S4D). Clustering of the DNF drug taxonomies identi fied a wide range of community sizes (Supplementary Fig., S8), with a median community size of 4 drugs both CTRPv2 and NCI60-based DNF taxonomies. Many of these communities were signi ficantly enriched for drug targets and ATC classes (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. S7). Among these for example, community C2 in CTRPv2 is statistically enriched against the ERBB2 and EGFR targets and contains well known inhibitors for these targets, such as afatinib,  erlotinib,  and lapatinib (Figs., 3 and 4A). Similarly C30 hosts almost all of the members of the statin family, which are known to affect the mevalonate pathway and HMGCR (Figs., 3 and 4A). We identi fied enrichment of DNF communities (based on NCI60) against several representative ATC categories (Supplementary Fig., S7B). These include communities enriched for knownFigure 3.

These are a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs and have been found to reduce cardiovascular disease., Inter- estingly parthenolide cluster s with this community, and has been experimentally observed to inhibit the NF- kbi nflamma- tory pathway in atherosclerosis and in colon cancer (32, 33),  thereby suggesting similar behavior to statin compounds., We also classi fied correctly drugs with unannotated mechanisms/ targets in CTRPv2 such as ifosfamide, cyclophosphamide,  andprocarbazine (C17,  Fig., 3), which are known alkylating agents (ATC code: L01A; Fig. 4). Furthermore, this was also true for docetaxel and paclitaxel (C21; Fig. 3) two taxane drugs with unannotated target in CTRPv2 although known as sharing similar MoA (ATC code, L01CD,  Fig., 4). Our integrative drug taxono my was also able to identify targets for drugs with poorly understood mechanisms and to infer new mechanism for other drugs., Community C15, for example, contains tigecycline and Col-3 (Fig. 3); both are derivatives of the antibiotic tetracycline (34). Tigecycline is an approved drug; however, its target is not characterized in humans. Col-3 showed antitu mor activities by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase (34). Interestingly tosedostat (CHR-2797), a metalloenzyme inhibitor with antiproliferative potential (35), is also a member of this community., Another drug in this community phloretin, is a natural compound with uncharacterized targets and has been recently shown to dereg- ulate matrix metalloproteinases at both gene and protein levels (36)., Our results suggest that matrix metalloproteinases would be the preferred target for drugs in this community., DNF also consolidated previous findings for drugs that may serve as tubulin polymerization disruptors and that have not been previously classi fied as such., We identi fied a community of three drugs (C49; Fig. 3) in which LY2183240 and YK-4-279 have been recently identi fied to decrease a-tubulin levels (14). Tivantinib, a c-MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor, also blocked microtubule polymerization (37). Interestingly, this commu- nity is tightly connected to known microtubule perturbagens (C21; Fig. 3).ABHMGCR PSMD2 PSMD1 PSMB5 PSMB2 PSMB1 PLK1 CDK4 CDK2 CDK1 NAMPT MAP2K2 MAP2K1 ERBB2 EGFR SRC HDAC8 HDAC3 HDAC2 HDAC1 ATM BCR ABL1 DRD2 EHMT2 BCL2L2 BCL2L1 BCL2 INSR IGF1R ALK MTOR PIK3CG PIK3CD PIK3CB PIK3CA PDGFRB PDGFR A MET TOP2A AURKB TOP1 TGFBR1 KIT FLT3 BRAF RARG KDR FLT1 HDAC6 DNMT1C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 C8 C14 C16 C18 C20 C22 C23 C24 C26 C28 C29 C30 C33 C38 C39 C41 C43 C45 C50 C52C17 C19 C20 C21 C30 C43 C52 L01AA L01CD C10AA L01CB L01AX L01BC N05AB Figure 4., Enrichment of drug communities of the DNF taxonomy (using CTRPv2 sensitivity data).

Cancer Res 77(11) June 1,  2017 Cancer Research 3064Downloaded from http, //aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/77/11/3057/2749991/3057.pdf by University Health Network user on 20 November 2023 The identi fication of community C33 including the BCL-2 inhibitors ABT-737 and navitoclax (Fig., 3) concurs with the study of Rees and colleagues. (38) where a high expression of BCL-2 was reported to confer sensitivity to these two drugs. This was not the case for another BCL-2 inhibitor obatoclax, for which they proposed that its metabolic modi fication in cells impacts its interaction with BCL-2 proteins, therefore reducing its potency., We showed indeed that obatoclax did not cluster with the other two BCL-2 inhibitors (ABT-737 and navitoclax)., Such an example demonstrates how the structural and sensitivity pro files of these two BCL-2 inhibitors are largely coherent, as opposed to obato- clax,  which previously showed off-target effects compared with ABT-737 (39)., This provides a good evidence to consider sensi- tivity pro files when developing new potent and speci fic BCL-2 inhibitors., Our results also suggest the existence of \"super communities \" that are a grouping of several communities contributing to a larger,  systems-based MoA., An example is provided by the tightly connected communities C3, C21, C23, C43 (Fig. 3). One of these communities (C3 alvocidib, PHA-793887 and staurosporine) includes well-characterized inhibitors of cyclin-dependant kinases (CDK) that are known to be major regulators of the cell cycle., BMS-345541 for example,  which also clusters with drugs in C3, is an ATP noncompetitive allosteric inhibitor of CDK (40)., Those compounds are positioned close in the community net- work to topoisomerase I and II inhibitors (C43, SN-38,  topotecan,  etoposide,  teniposide),  microtubule dynamics perturbators (C21,  paclitaxel, docetaxel,  vincristine,  parbendazole) and polo-like kinase inhibitors (C23,  GSK461364, GW843682X)., Iorio and colleagues reported that the similarity between CDK inhibitors and the other DNA-damaging agents is mediated through a p21 induction, which explains the interconnection and rationale of similar transcriptional and sensitivity effects of these regulators of cell-cycle progression (7)., DNF based on NCI60 sensitivity information enabled iden- tification of three tightly connected drug communities, C2,  C5,  C32 (Supplementary Fig., S6). These communities contain a number of compounds that showed antitumor activity by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS, communities C2,  elesclomol,  fenretinide,  C5,  ethacrynic acid,  curcumin,  C32,  bortezomib, menadione)., Interestingly ethacrynic acid,  an FDA-approved drug indicated for hypertension, clustered with curcumin,  a component of turme ric., Ethacrynic acid inhibits glutathione S-transferase (GSTP 1) and induced mitochondrial- dependent apoptosis through generation of ROS and induc- tion of caspases (41)., Curcumin showed antitumor activity by production of ROS and promotion of apoptotic signaling. Thus our results suggest that GSTP1 could be a potential target of the widely used natural compound curcumin., Interestingly some of the identi fied communities using NCI60, such as the tight connection between BRAF/MEK inhibitor drugs (C42,  Supplementary Fig., S6), had also been identi fied in our orig- inal analysis using CTRPv2 sensitivity pro files. This demon- strates a high degree of speci ficity of drug target associations across cell lines and experimental platforms, which is crucial for precision medicine., Discussion Identi fication of drug mechanisms for uncharacterized com- pounds is instrumental for determination of on-targets respon-sible of pharmacologic effects, and off-targets associated with unexpected physiologic effects., Shortcomings of current approaches include a degree of reliance on pharmacologic bio- chemical, and functional annotations that pertain to existing,  well-characterized drugs, and which may not be applicable towards prediction of a new small compounds (12,  42)., To address this issue we developed DNF,  a high-throughput,  sys- tematic, and unbiased approach that relies on basic and comple- mentary drug characteristics, and harnesses this integrative clas- sification to provide a global picture of drug relationships., In this analysis we have conducted to our knowledge the first large-scale integration of high-throughput drug-related data that encompasses drug structure, sensitivity,  and perturbation signa- tures towards elucidating drug drug relationships., We have removed any reliance on existing annotations that pertain to existing drugs such as drug target classi fications or knowledge of the anatomic and organ system targeted by the drug com- pounds., As a consequence we developed a scalable approach that relies only on basic drug information, making DNF both flexible for comprehensive drug classi fication, but also adaptable for testing new experimental compounds with minimal information (Fig., 5). Our high-throughput drug similarity network (DNF) capi- talized upon our integrative Similarity Network Fusion method (15) to construct a global drug taxonomy based on the fusion of drug structure, sensitivity,  and perturbation data., The con- struction of drug-similarity networks and their subsequent fusion allows us to harness t he complementary nature of several drug datasets to infer an integrative drug taxonomy., Testing how well different drug taxonomies can correctly pre- dict drug targets (Fig. 2A and B) and anatomic (ATC) drug classi fications (Fig. 2C and D) indicates that DNF constitutes a significant improvement toward drug classi fication compared with single data type analyses using either drug sensitivity,  structure, or perturbation information alone., The marked improvement of drug classi fication using the similarity net- work-based method is sustained even with the use of a different source of in vitro sensitivity data (NCI60, Supplementary Fig., S5) to generate the DNF similarity matrix. Indeed testing DNF using the NCI60 sensitivity information reveals that our inte- grative taxonomy consistently supersedes single-layer drug taxonomies across the target and ATC benchmarks despite the reduced number of cell lines used for sensitivity screening (Supplementary Fig., S5). While DNF was not intended as a supervised approach to predict drug targets and ATC classi fica- tions per se , the ability to ef ficiently predict different drug classes provide credence to us ing our novel similarity net- work-based method to discover drug relationships., DNF is the only method that is consistently the top performer while each single-layer taxonomy performs well in only a few cases (Fig., 2; Supplementary Fig. S5). Overall these observations indicate that our integrative approach succeeds in combining several drug data types into a single comprehensive network that efficiently leverages the spectrum of the underlying data., Our explorative analysis stresses the importance of drug sen- sitivity information as an important asset for prediction of drug  target associations (Fig., 2A and B; Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). Such findings support the relevance of pharmacologic assays to predict drug targets and underscore the comprehensive nature of the CTRPv2 dataset (860 cell lines screened with 16 drug concentrations, tested in duplicate,  ref., 14). Similarity we haveIntegrative Drug Taxonomy Using Pharmacogenomics www.aacrjournals.org Cancer Res, 77(11) June 1,  2017 3065Downloaded from http, //aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/77/11/3057/2749991/3057.pdf by University Health Network user on 20 November 2023 observed a priority for drug structure information toward predic- tion of ATC drug classi fication (Fig., 2C and D; Supplementary Fig. S5C and S5D). We have also conducted a quantitative comparison of the predictive performance of DNF against four published drug classi fication algorithms (3, 7,  8,  43) that could be directly compared with the DNF approach (Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Fig., S9; Supplementary Table S5). DNF outper- forms the published methods in all cases (Supplementary Fig. S9). We performed a community detection analysis on our inte- grated drug networks and highlighted many cases of drug clusters (drug communities) with known MoA, thereby capturing context- specific features associated to drug sensitivity and transcriptomic profiles in cancer cells (Fig., 3; Supplementary Fig. S6). These cases serve both as \"positive controls\" as well as validation of our methods. We demonstrated that DNF correctly identi fied com- munities of BRAF inhibitors and MAPK/MEK inhibitors,  among others in the CTRPv2 taxonomy (Fig., 3). We also highlight several well-characterized drug communities using the DNF taxonomy based on the NCI60 dataset (Supplementary Fig., S6). Our quan- titative assessment of the clusters identi fied from the DNF net- work revealed several communities that were signi ficantly enriched for drug targets as well as ATC classes (Fig., 4; Supple- mentary Fig. S7), which underscores the biological relevance of the drug clusters that we had identi fied. Collectively these find- ings support the relevance of DNF for the classi fication of drug relationships across several classes of drugs., Importantly we compared the DNF drug communities to previously published data, and found an overlap between our results and clinical observations., For example ibrutinib, which is a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of Mantle cell lym- phoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, clustered with theknown EGFR inhibitors (C2,  erlotinib,  ge fitinib,  afatinib,  and others)., The effect of ibrutinib in EGFR mutant non small cell lung cancer has been reported in a recent clinical trial (Clinical- Trials.gov Identi fier, NCT02321540)., This was also the case for MGCD265 a Met inhibitor, which clustered with most of the VEGFR (VEGF receptor) inhibitors (C50,  pazopanib, cediranib and others)., In this community pazopanib is the only FDA- approved drug for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma., Recent evidence shows that the clinical drug candidate MGCD265 can be used to treat renal malignancies (ClinicalTrials.gov Identi fier, NCT00697632)., Since polypharmacology provides great opportunities for drug repurposing through simultaneous blockade of multiple targets or pathways (44), we investigated whether our integrative drug taxonomy can be used to identify compounds with multiple targets., For example we showed that the two speci fic ALK inhi- bitors in CTRPv2 (crizotinib and TAE684) cluster closely to the IGF-1R inhibitors (linsitinib and BMS536924)., This finding con- curs with the results of Seashore-Ludlow and colleagues showing that TAE684 and crizotinib contribute to IGF-1R inhibition in neuroblastoma cancer cell lines (45)., Our approach is able to capture other relevant off-target effects by showing that a known c- MET kinase inhibitor (tivantinib) clusters with microtubule poly- merization inhibitors, which was con firmed by Katayama and colleagues (37)., The current availability of sensitivity data and its overlap with drug perturbation and drug structure information remains a limiting factor., LINCS L1000 (46) was favored over CMAP (9) for drug perturbation datasets as it contains a larger set of drug compounds (L1000 1420, 326 vs. CMAP 141, 309)., Similarly we used the pharmacologic pro files from the CTRPv2 (14) and Drug concentration100 50 0.01 0.1 1.0 10 100New, experimental compound Determine basic compound informationDrug dose response curvesDrug chemical structureDrug transcriptomic perturbation Inference of potential drug target and MoANew compoundDrug-target information% Viability Anatomical classification Drug network fusion + Identification of drug communitiesFigure 5., Schematic of the adaptability of DNF towards prediction of new experimental compounds. A user can cluster his own drug (e.g. bioactive molecule with uncharacterized MoA) in DNF to characterize its mechanism of action by providing the following data, (i) the chemical structure as a canonical SMILES string, (ii) list of genes perturbed by the chemical compound in at least three cell lines (genome-wide transcriptional studies are preferred to get a maximum overlap with the set of 1000 landmark genes), (iii) sensitivity profiles (e.g.,  area under the drug- dose response curve), including measurements of cell growth in culture medium in 9 concentrations for at least 50 cell lines from multiple tissue types., By adding these new data to our current datasets a user will be able to assess in which community their drug of interest clusters and subsequently infer its potential MoA., No information regarding the compound's target or anatomical therapeutic classi fication is required for DNF taxonomy.El-Hachem et al., Cancer Res 77(11) June 1,  2017 Cancer Research 3066Downloaded from http, //aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/77/11/3057/2749991/3057.pdf by University Health Network user on 20 November 2023 NCI60 datasets because they contain a large number of drugs compared with GDSC (47) or CCLE (48) or other smaller datasets (CTRPv2 14481 and NCI60 1449, 938 vs. GDSC 14251 and CCLE1424)., Our taxonomy is currently composed of nearly 240 drugs with drug structure perturbation, and sensitivity data available., The number of drugs with multiple data layer is likely to increase as the LINCS L1000 is expanding at fast pace and new sensitivity data are frequently released (47, 49)., Therefore we developed DNF with scalability in mind as we expect the number of drugs in our network to increase continuously over time., Recognizing that the exploration of large-scale drug similarity network is challen ging we developed the DNF web application to interactively display the CTRPv2 and NCI60 drug similarity networks (dnf.pmgenomics.ca)., We leveraged the cytoscape.js library (28) to allow users to easily navigate drug communities and investigate the drugs within each community and their similarities., In particular users can use the DNF web application to determine,  for a given drug drug similarity, which data layer contributed most to the similarity score, therefore providing detailed information about drug commu- nities detected using our integrative taxonomy., The recent release of large-scale pharmacogenomic datasets such as those generated within the CTRPv2 and LINCS L1000 projects, provides a unique opportunity to further investigate the effects of approved and experimental drugs on cancer models and their potential mode of action., Methods leveraging DNF in combination with the wealth of molecular pro files from cancer cell lines and patient tumors hold the potential to identify robust biomarkers and improve drug matching for individual patients, which would constitute a major step towards precision medicine and drug repurposing in cancer., This study has several potential limitations. First the number of drugs with all data layers available is limited by the small overlap between drug sensitivity and perturbation datasets., As these datasets grow, the DNF taxonomy will expand proportion- ally. Second the L1000 is a relatively new dataset and there is no consensus yet on how to best normalize the data and compute the transcriptomic perturbation signature for each drug., In this study we used the gene expression data as normalized by the Broad Institute (QNORM, level 3 data) and the signature model implemented in PharmacoGx (21),  however, we recognize that other pipelines could be used to mine the L1000 dataset and potentially improve DNF, such as the multilevel mixed-effect model recently published by Vis and colleagues (50)., While it remains unclear that the use of more complex models will improve the drug perturbation signatures, our study provides a benchmark to assess the bene fits of such approaches., Third the low number of cell lines in speci fic tissue types in L1000 prevented us from creating tissue-speci fic integrative taxonomies to better explore the molecular context of drug MoA., This limitation could be overcome with the availability of perturba- tion pro files for more cell lines in the future., Fourth given that SuperPred and DrugE-Rank websites only report the top predic- tions but not the full list of drugs with similar targets or ATC codes, we computed the distance between these partial rankings to compute similarities between drugs (Supplementary Meth- ods)., Similarly a direct comparison between DNF and the taxonomy inferred using Iorio and colleagues and Iskar and colleagues' methods is not possible due their reliance on CMAP., The adaptation of these methods for the L1000 dataset was challenging due to the reduced set of 1 000 genes., Consequently the results of the comparison between DNF and published methods should be interpreted cautiously., Finally while Pear- son's correlation coef ficient has been shown to be suitable to detect similarities between drug sensitivity pro files for drugs with broad or narrow inhibitory effects (51, 52), there is currently no consensus on the best similarity metric to compare pharmaco- logic pro files and new methods are under active development (53)., We also had to use different drug sensitivity measures for CTRPv2 and NCI60 as both projects released different types of pharmacologic pro files, CTRPv2 reported percentage of cell viability while NCI60 reported percentage of growth inhibition controlled for population doubling time., Despite these hetero- geneous drugs sensitivity data we observed similar communities for the drugs in common between the two sensitivity datasets, supporting the robustness of DNF., In conclusion we developed an integrative taxonomy inference approach,  DNF, leveraging the largest quantitative compendiums of structural information, pharmacologic phenotypes,  and tran- scriptional perturbation pro files to date., We used DNF to conduct a comparative assessment between our integrative taxonomy and single-layer drug taxonomies, as well as published methods used to predict drug targets or functional annotations., Our results support the superiority of DNF toward drug classi fication and also highlight singular data types that are pivotal toward predic- tion of drug categories in terms of anatomic classi fication as well as drug target relationships., Overall the DNF taxonomy has produced the best performance, most consistent classi fication of drugs for multiple functional classes., The comprehensive picture of drug drug relationships produced by DNF has also succeeded in predicting new drug MoA., The integrative DNF taxonomy has the potential to serve as a solid framework for future studies involving inference of MoA of new, uncharacterized compounds, which represents a major challenge in drug development for precision medicine., Disclosure of Potential Con flicts of Interest No potential con flicts of interest were disclosed.
