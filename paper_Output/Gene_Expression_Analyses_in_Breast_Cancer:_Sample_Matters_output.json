Cescon See the Notes section for the full list of authors affiliations., Correspondence to David Cescon,  MD,  PhD,  Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre,  610 University Ave,  Toronto M5G 2M9 (e-mail, dave.cescon@uhn.ca)., Since the advent of microarray technologies that permit high- throughput gene expression analyses in tumor samples, therehas been an explosion of data generated, both through the anal- ysis of archived clinical material and through prospective stud- ies that expressly collect samples for molecular analyses ( 13)., Fortunately much of this has been made publicly availablethrough shared repositories, enabling investigators without di-rect access to clinical material the opportunity to carry out dis- covery and validation studies to better characterize the molecular basis of tumor behavior and response to therapies(4, 5)., The recent efforts of The Cancer Genome Atlas and other groups to generate comprehensive molecular profiles of humancancers have further enriched these data sets, now using the current state-of-the-art RNA-seq technologies ( 2, 3)., There are few areas of cancer research where gene expres- sion profiling has had as great an impact as in breast cancer.Both in basic research and clinical application, gene expressionanalysis underlies the common molecular classification schemes (eg, intrinsic subtypes), and its importance is second only to the gold standard pathological measurement of estrogenreceptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermalgrowth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in defining treatment plans for individual patients ( 611)., The development and validation of prognostic gene expression classifiers in early breast cancer (eg OncotypeDX [ 12],  Prosigna [ 13],  Mammaprint [ 14],  Gene expres- sion Grade Index [ 15], and others) has substantially refined ad- juvant chemotherapy decision-making, permitting optimized delivery of this treatment and sparing thousands of women toxic therapy where it is not required ( 16)., Given the central role gene expression analyses play in the in- vestigation and management of breast cancer, the report by Gao etal., (17) describing artifactual gene expression changes in serially sampled specimens collected as part of a randomized controlled trial, are particularly relevant to the design and interpretation ofgene expression biomarker studies., In their accompanying article the authors build on previous reports describing alterations in gene expression related to delays in tissue processing following sam-pling, including substantial changes in early response genes be- tween diagnostic core biopsies and surgical specimens ( 1820)., They now analyze and compare whole-genome expression datafrom samples of ER breast cancers obtained by core needle biopsy at baseline and paired surgical specimens obtained after two weeksof preoperative aromatase inhibitor treatment (AI), or control from the POETIC trial ( 21)., The analysis of gene expression alterations in the treated group identified major signaling pathways known to beaffected by estrogen deprivation, in addition,  as previouslyreported, substantial changes in some genes are documented incontrol-treated patients, which are attributed to pre-analytical vari- ables in sample collection and handling., Namely the baseline core biopsies were processed directly, whereas the surgical specimenswere handled routinely following resection (often with a delay forclinical assessment), and core cut samples were obtained from thepathology specimens., This would result in substantial differences in ischemic time that could produce cellular responses and affect sample integrity., Gao et al. showed that many of the genes whoseexpression is most altered between baseline and surgery in the AI-treated group are also those affected in the control arm (Figure 1) (17)., This is a striking finding as it indicates that the genes that could have been attributed to AI treatment were actually due to aconfounding factor., The possibility that the expression changes inthe surgical samples of the control group were the result of the in-tervening biopsy causing a wound healing, immune,  or other per- turbation was addressed by an analysis of a different trial (FAIMoS), where the post-AI samples were collected by a repeatcore biopsy prior to surgical resection of the tumor ( 22)., With the benefit of treatment and control groups in POETIC the authorsconclude that the sampling differences in serial specimen collec- tion resulted in the detection of purely artifactual changes in some genes, while also masking real treatment-induced changes in othergenes., Received: April 4, 2018; Accepted: April 12, 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

Prospective studies toevaluate pharmacodynamic effects of novel therapies are of- ten undertaken in early phase clinical trials, which do not al- ways include a control arm ( 32)., In this setting where analysis of paired samples may be used to adjudicate drug effect, de-termine dosing,  infer potential predictive biomarkers, or iden-tify putative combination partners, care must be taken to account for technical confounders in downstream analyses if technical controls cannot be integrated in the study design.This is especially critical in window of opportunity trials, where no therapeutic effect is expected, or in studies of agentswhose biological effect is weaker or less well-defined than the AIs studied in POETIC., In such cases harmonizing baseline and end-of-treatment sampling procedures (ie,  paired biop-sies, as used in FAIMOS),  as well as inclusion of a controlgroup,  is likely advisable, and is typically lacking when as-sessment of routinely available archival tissue samples is performed., Retrospective analyses of paired tissue specimens com- monly performed in situations where mature outcome clinicaldata are required, are even more likely to suffer from technical differences in tissue sampling., Examples include the compari- son of residual disease (at surgery) with pretreatment biopsiesin the neoadjuvant setting to identify correlates of drug resis-tance, or metastatic disease (biopsies) to resected primaries (atsurgery) to identify features associated with disease progression and dissemination., Attempts to control for potential confound- ing factors arising from technical issues in retrospective studiesrequire both the recognition that this phenomenon is presentand a database of important artifactual changes, as Gao et al.provided in their supplemental data for presurgical ER breast cancer., While some of these are likely to be common to other histologies attention to other settings is necessary to accountfor disease-specific alterations., Failure to consider and controlfor such changes can and undoubtedly will, result in spuriousresults and misleading conclusions., For those working in this area, take heed: the sample matters.

      "question": "Describe the methodology used in the paper.",
      "answer": "The methodology used in the paper involves a comparative analysis of gene expression data from breast cancer samples obtained through different sampling methods. Specifically, the authors analyze whole-genome expression data from estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer samples collected via core needle biopsy at baseline and paired surgical specimens obtained after two weeks of preoperative aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment, as part of the POETIC trial.\n\nKey aspects of the methodology include:\n\n1. **Sample Collection**: The study compares samples collected through two different methods: core needle biopsies processed directly and surgical specimens that underwent routine handling, often with delays for clinical assessment. This difference in processing times is critical as it affects the ischemic time and, consequently, the integrity of the samples.\n\n2. **Gene Expression Analysis**: The authors focus on identifying alterations in gene expression due to treatment with aromatase inhibitors and also examine changes in the control group. They highlight that substantial gene expression changes can occur due to pre-analytical variables in sample collection and handling.\n\n3. **Comparison of Treatment and Control Groups**: The study utilizes data from both treated and control groups to discern whether observed gene expression changes are due to the treatment or are artifacts of the sampling methodology. This is further supported by an analysis of another trial (FAIMoS) where post-AI samples were collected through repeat core biopsies prior to surgical resection.\n\n4. **Addressing Confounding Factors**: The authors discuss the potential confounding factors arising from the differences in sampling techniques and emphasize the importance of harmonizing sampling procedures in clinical studies to avoid misleading conclusions.\n\n5. **Data Interpretation**: The findings are interpreted in the context of how sampling methodology can lead to the detection of artifactual gene expression changes, which may mask genuine treatment-induced changes.\n\nOverall, the methodology underscores the significance of sample handling and processing in gene expression studies, particularly in the context of breast cancer research, and advocates for careful design in biomarker studies to ensure accurate interpretation of results."
