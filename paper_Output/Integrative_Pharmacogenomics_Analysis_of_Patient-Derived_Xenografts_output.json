Wang1, 2,  Ben Brew3,  Janosch Ortmann4, Ming-Sound Tsao1, 2,  David W. Cescon1,  Anna Goldenberg3, 5, 6,  and Benjamin Haibe-Kains1, 2, 5, 6, 7 Abstract Identifying robust biomarkers of drug response constitutes a key challenge in precision medicine., Patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX) have emerged as reliable preclinical models that more accurately recapitulate tumor response to chemo- and targeted therapies., However the lack of computational tools makes it dif ficult to analyze high-throughput molecular and pharmacologic pro files of PDX., We have developed Xenograft Visualization & Analysis (Xeva) an open-source software package for in vivo pharmacogenomic datasets that allows for quanti fication of variability in gene expression and pathway activity across PDX passages., We found that only a few genes and pathways exhibited passage-speci fic alterations and were therefore not suitable for biomarker discovery., Using the largest PDX pharmacogenomic dataset to date weidenti fied 87 pathways that are signi ficantly associated with response to 51 drugs (FDR <0.05)., We found novel biomar- kers based on gene expressions copy number aberrations, and mutations predictive of drug response (concordance index >0.60,  FDR <0.05)., Our study demonstrates that Xeva provides a flexible platform for integrative analysis of preclinical in vivo pharmacogenomics data to identify bio- markers predictive of drug response, representing a major step forward in precision oncology., Significance A computational platform for PDX data anal- ysis reveals consistent gene and pathway activity across passages and con firms drug response prediction biomarkers in PDX., See related commentary by Meehan p. 4324 Introduction Preclinical models are vital for investigating disease biology and therapeutics, constituting essential tools for translational research and drug development., In cancer research immortalized cell lines are the most used preclinical models because of their low cost, flexibility, and the existence of assays enabling genetic and chemical screen in a high-throughput manner., However, the cell line models suffer from multiple limitations. Although they are derived from patient tumors they have evolved to survive in artificial culture conditions resulting in major alterations at the genomic level (1 6)., These in vitro models also lack the tumor heterogeneity and three-dimensional structure of the origin patient tumor (4, 7 9)., To create cancer models that better recapitulate the tumor molecular features and drug response the pharmaceutical indus-try and academia massively invested in the development of patient-derived xenografts (PDX, ref., 10), which enable engraft- ment of human tumors in animal models (11 17). PDXs are created by subcutaneous or orthotopic engraftment of the cancer- ous tissues or cells from patients' tumors into immunode ficient mice., Once established these tumors can be passed from mouse to mouse, leading to consecutive \"passages\" of the initial tumor cells., PDX models are being generated and distributed by several academic groups research institutes, and commercial organi- zations., This makes it challenging to find PDX models with speci fic characteristics such as a model with a speci ficm u t a t i o n ., Therefore catalogs of PDX models [e.g.,  PDXFinder (18),  EurOPDX (19), and PRoXe (20)] are being developed, which contain relevant information and provide links to model acquisition., Furthermore as PDXs are becoming the gold- standard model for preclinical studies, better data standardi- z a t i o na n da n a l y s i sp l a t f o r m sa r er e q u i r e dt oe n s u r ec o n s i s - tency and reproducibility in PDX-based analysis., Recently a r o b u s ts t a n d a r dc a l l e dP D Xm o dels minimal information (PDX-MI) has been proposed (21) for reporting and quality assurance for PDX models., Howe ver management,  analysis, and visualization of the PDX-based drug screening and geno- mic data still constitute major challenges., Here we present Xenograft Visualization and Analysis (Xeva) a computational package enabling storage,  access,  and analysis ofin vivo pharmacogenomics data., The Xeva toolbox facilitates biomarker discovery in PDX-based pharmacogenomic data. It implements class structure to manage and connect PDX- based drug screening data to the genomic features of the corresponding tumor., It provides functions for PDX data anal- ysis including multiple metrics to summarize drug response1Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network,  Toronto,  Ontario,  Canada.2Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto,  Toronto,  Ontario,  Canada.3Hospital for Sick Children,  Toronto,  Ontario, Canada., 4D/C19epartement de Management et Technologie Universit /C19ed uQ u /C19ebec /C18a Mon- tr/C19eal, Montreal,  Quebec,  Canada.5Department of Computer Science,  University of Toronto,  Toronto, Ontario,  Canada.6Vector Institute,  Toronto,  Ontario, Canada.7Ontario Institute for Cancer Research,  Toronto,  Ontario,  Canada., Note Supplementary data for this article are available at Cancer Research Online (http, //cancerres.aacrjournals.org/)., Corresponding Author Benjamin Haibe-Kains,  University Health Network,  101 College Street, Toronto,  Ontario M5G 1L7,  Canada., Phone 416-581-7628,  Fax,  416-581-8626,  E-mail,  benjamin.haibe.kains@utoronto.ca Cancer Res 2019, 79, 4539 50 doi, 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-0349 /C2112019 American Association for Cancer Research.Cancer Research www.aacrjournals.org 4539Downloaded from http, //aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/79/17/4539/2780767/4539.pdf by University Health Network user on 20 November 2023 for tumor growth curves., Furthermore Xeva provides functions to compute the association between genomic features and response to a drug in PDXs (gene drug association)., Different response metrics for the PDX growth curve can be used as outcome to identify novel gene drug associations that can act as drug companion tests., Using the Xeva platform we analyzed gene expression of PDXs across passages and demonstrated that activity patterns of the majority of the genes and pathways are stable across different PDX passages., We identi fied multiple pathways signi ficantly associated with anticancer drug response including known and new biomarkers based on gene expression,  copy number aberrations (CNA), and mutations., Our results support the value of large-scale PDX-based drug screening for biomarker discovery using the integrative phar- macogenomic analysis pipelines implemented in the Xeva computational platform., Materials and Methods Processing of pharmacogenomic data Gene expression data PDX passages, and tissue information were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus and publica- tions (Fig., 1). Molecular pro files including mutation CNA,  gene expression, and pharmacologic pro files were obtained from the publication Gao and colleagues (17) and Gene Expression Omni- bus series GSE78806., Gene expression pro files were normalized with the RMA algorithm in the Affypackage (version 1.58.0) in Bioconductor (22)., PDX passages and tissue information were curated manually. Data were processed using R statistical software (http://www.r-project.org/). For mutation CNA and RNAseq- based gene expression data, processed values were directly down- load from Gao and colleagues' publication (17)., The final dataset contains 3 470 unique PDX models tested across 57 treatments and derived from 191 patients spanning across 5 different cancer types., Implementation PDX pharmacogenomic experiments aim to investigate how tumor volume changes in in vivo models with respect to time, with and without drug treatment., The corresponding metadata such as drug dose, number of days from tumor implantation to treatment start, or reason for stopping the experiment (e.g., whether mice died because of complications or were sacri ficed due to maximal allowed tumor volume reached), are crucial factors for down- stream analysis., In the Xeva platform we have developed the XevaSet class to effectively store pharmacologic response (time vs. tumor volume) of PDXs along with metadata related to the experiments and molecular data (Supplementary Fig., S1). Fur- thermore to store individual PDX (mouse) model data,  we have implemented the pdxModel class, which provides slots for PDX-MI variables,  along with time versus tumor volume data., Detailed schematics of the XevaSet and pdxModel classes are shown in Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3, respectively. XevaSet object can contain multi-omics data which are linked to individual xeno- graft models and their pharmacologic pro files., Data can be sub- setted by metadata and experimental factors, such as tumor types or drug names. PDX experiment design In vivo evaluation of drug sensitivity in cancer xenografts has traditionally used experimental approaches incorporating multi-ple animals (5 10) replicates for each control and treatment arm., This experimental design allows the assessment of the variabil- ity in the PDX drug response across individual animals (23)., However scaling this strategy for high-throughput drug screen- ing is costly and requires the use of a large number of exper- imental animals., To increase t he number of compounds being tested reduce cost, and permit the use of fewer animals to provide essential data (24), a simpler \"1 /C21/C2100experimental design for PDX clinical trial (PCT) has been proposed (17, 25)., In this design, each compound is tested in only 1 PDX model from each patient (Supplementary Fig. S4). Although the 1 /C21/C21 experiment design allows high-throughput screening at reduced cost it is more prone to experimental errors due to lack of replications., Factors such as difference in the handling of mice or measurement errors in the tumor volume and biological variability in tumor growth rates between animals could signi ficantly impact the results., We foresee that both experimental design strategies will coexist where the 1 /C21/C21 experiment design will be used for population-level and high-throughput screening, whereas the replicate-based experiment design will be used for more focus- ed studies where discrimination of small differences in drug response is a desired outcome., We therefore implemented functions to accommodate both experimental designs for data visualization and statistical analyses., PDX response metrics Given the lack of consensus regarding the best summary metrics to estimate in vivo drug response (17, 26 29), we implemented the state-of-the-art response metrics used for PDX-based drug response experiments., These include the slope of curves angle between the mean control and treatment curves, tumor growth inhibition (TGI),  area between the curves,  linear mixed mod- el (28), best average response (BAR),  best response (BR),  and mRECIST (17)., For each PDX model least squares fits were obtained by regressing tumor volume at each time point as,  V14abT, where Vdenotes tumor volume,  Tdenotes time., The intercept and slope are denoted by aandb, respectively. Subsequently the angle was computed using inverse tangent of regression line slope as, Angle 14tan/C01b The TGI is de fined as,  TGI14VC/C0VT  =VC0/C0VT0  , where VC and VT are the median of control and treated growth curve,  respectively, at the end of the study., VC 0and VT 0indicate the initial tumor volume for control and treated growth curve, respectively. The BAR metric for each PDX model is de fined as follows At each time point t, the normalized change in tumor volume is computed as DVt14Vt/C0V0  V0 Next,  for each time t, the running average of DVtfrom t140t o t was calculated., BAR is de fined as the minimum of this running average (at t/C2110 days).

Similarly plotmRECIST displays mRECIST-based drug response as a heatmap, with drugs along heatmap rows and PDXs along columns., Heatmap cells are colored according to the mRECIST value for the corresponding PDXdrug pair. Gene expression consistency analysis We calculated the Pearson correlation coef ficient between pairs of samples belonging to the same lineage using all available gene expression., For comparison we also computed the Pearson correlation coef ficient between all possible pairs of samples that do not belong to the same lineage., Similar analysis was performed using the L1000 landmark gene set (30). For genes we computed the intraclass correlation coef ficient (ICC) using the psych pack- age (version 1.8.4)., For a particular gene, in each sample we computed its rank by sorting the expression values. The rank of genes along with passage information is used for ICC calculation. ICC values of the genes were used to perform gene-set enrichment analysis on the MSigDB hallmark gene sets and Reactome path- way database (31), which contains gene sets associated with specific pathways., Pathways and gene drug association analysis We computed the association between a molecular feature and response to a drug across PDXs (commonly referred to as gene  drug association or drug response predicting biomarker)., The genedrug association was assessed separately for all three avail- able molecular features that is,  gene expression,  CNA,  and gene mutation., The response of PDXs to a drug treatment is de fined using BAR. The association between genomic feature and PDX response was computed using nonparametric measure of association, concordance index (CI)., The CI represents the probability that two variables will rank a random pair of samples the same order., For each drug we compiled a list of potential biomarkers using OncoKB (32),  DrugBank, and literature curation., We adjusted the Pvalue using FDR for drug combinations and drugs with multiple potential biomarkers. Univariate gene drug associations were calculated for three different molecular pro filing modalities that are gene expression, copy number variation,  and mutation., For drugpathway association analysis, the Reactome pathway data- base (31) was used. We created a subset of the pathway database by selecting only the gene sets containing at least 1 potential drug target and containing less than 300 genes., We also grouped the drugs in different classes according to their genomic target. In total, we selected 94 pathways related to 57 drugs and drugs were classi fied into 11 classes. Pathway analysis was performed usingthe R Piano package (version 1.20.1; ref. 33). We used the R package ComplexHeatmap (version 1.20.0) to visualize the gene  drug associations and R package circlize (version 0.4.6) to visu- alize the drug pathway association (34)., Research reproducibility The open-source Xeva package is available from GitHub (https //github.com/bhklab/Xeva) at under GPLv3 license and Bioconductor repository (http, //bioconductor.org/packages/ Xeva/)., We also provide a complete software environment through Code Ocean containing all necessary data and code to reproduce the analysis and figures described in this manuscript under the doi https, //doi.org/10.24433/CO.bfb2dd77-53a3- 4083-bf3a-16504fc8c786., Results Xeva follows PDX-MI standards to store pharmacogenomic data We designed XevaSet a new object class enabling integration of molecular and pharmacologic pro files of PDXs (Supplementary Figs., S1 S3) following the recent minimal information for patient-derived tumor xenograft models (PDX-MI) standard for reporting on the generation, quality assurance,  and use of PDX models (21)., The PDX-MI standard ensures that all necessary clinical attributes of the tumor along with PDX-related essential experimental information, such as host mouse strain and passage information,  is reported., Given that this information is crucial for downstream analysis and research reproducibility we have implemented the pdxModel class (Supplementary Figs., S2 S4) that provides slots for PDX-MI variables. In this study, we curated the recent Novartis PDX Encyclopedia (PDXE; ref. 17) and created the PDXE XevaSet object (Fig. 1A and B Supplementary Table S1) to investigate the consistency of gene expression patterns across passages and mine the pharmacogenomic data for known and new biomarkers predictive of drug response in vivo ., Xeva provides useful functions for analysis and visualization of PDX-based pharmacogenomic data. For every PDX model in the PDXE breast cancer dataset mRECIST-based response metrics was computed using the Xeva function response (Fig., 1C). Heatmaps representing the mRECIST data cutaneous melanoma (CM) colorectal cancer,  gastric cancer, non small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma can be found in Supplementary Figs., S5 to S9, respectively. Visualization of PDX growth curves is an essential part of data quality control and analysis. Tumor growth curves for individual PDX models and for matched control-treatment models can be plotted using the plotPDX function (Supplementary Table S2)., Examples of PDX tumor growth curves in control (untreated) and treatment (pac- litaxel) conditions are shown in Fig., 1D. All 4,483 tumor growth curves with matched control can be found in Supplementary Data File S1. PDX-related genomic data and linked drug screening response data can be extracted using the function summarizeMo- lecularPro files(Supplementary Table S2)., Similarly the drugSensi- tivitySig function (Supplementary Table S2) allows users to quan- tify the strength of each gene drug association using a linear regression model., Gene expression is consistent across passages PDX models are known to better represent the molecular characters of human tumor compared with simpler in vitroMer et al., Cancer Res 79(17) September 1,  2019 Cancer Research 4542Downloaded from http, //aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/79/17/4539/2780767/4539.pdf by University Health Network user on 20 November 2023 models (13, 35,  36)., PDXs show high similarity to patient samples for mutation rate (17 37) and CNA (13) and methyl- ation (38) patterns,  histological and molecular sub- types (13,  36, 39)., Before conducting drug screening PDXs arepassaged multiple times with the assumption that genomic characteristics of PDXs are stable across passages., Several studies have shown that mutation and copy number patterns are largely stable across passages (14, 36,  40 44)., However, a meta-analysis Figure 2.

To visualize theconsistency of gene expression patterns across passages we per- formed a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis and projected the high-dimensional PDX gene expression data into a two-dimensional plot (Fig., 2B). PDXs derived from a patient but belonging to different passages (de fined as belonging to same lineage) were linked together in the t-SNE visualization., We observed that in the visualization PDXs from the same lineage are projected nearby even though coming from different passages., Next we computed the Pearson correlation coef ficient for all pairs of PDX samples belonging to same lineage using all available genes (Fig., 2C) and L1000 gene set (Supplementary Fig. S10). We A BNull Null Null Null Null Null Null Null Null m Figure 3. PDX maintains expression pattern of the genes across passages.

Barplot shows top 10 pathway s with negative enrichment score in ge ne-set enrichment analysis. Only one pathway has a statistically signi ficant (FDR <0.05) negative enrichment score across PDX passages.Mer et al., Cancer Res 79(17) September 1,  2019 Cancer Research 4544Downloaded from http, //aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/79/17/4539/2780767/4539.pdf by University Health Network user on 20 November 2023 found that the median Pearson correlation for related pairs is high (0.98) in comparison with nonrelated tissue-speci fic PDX pairs (0.87) and the difference was statistically signi ficant (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P<0.0001)., Collectively these results strongly support that the gene expression pro file of PDXs is consistent across different passages., For speci fic genes however,  the expres- sion behavior can vary across PDX passages, which may affect drug response depending on which passage is used for drug testing., We therefore assessed stability of each gene across pas- sages by computing the intraclass correlation coef ficient (ICC) for genes in samples from same PDX lineage for all tissue types and stratified by tissue type (Fig., 3A). We found that the ICC values of genes in pairs of related PDXs are higher when compared with nonrelated pairs (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P<1E/C015)., Further- more the ICC values of genes are skewed towards high values, indicating that the majority of genes have a stable expression pattern across PDX passages., Our results show that expression patterns of known biomarker genes such as EGFR ERBB2 , and MAP2K1 are stable across passage (Table 1,  Supplementary Data File S2)., Consistent with Rubio-Viqueira and colleagues (46) we found that expression of genes such as VEGFA, MDM2 ,  and CDK4 is stable in pancreatic cancer PDXs., To identify pathways that are enriched with unstable genes we performed a gene set enrichment analysis with the genome-wide ranking of genes based on their stability across passages (ICC values, Fig., 3B; Supplementary Data Files S3 and S4). Pathways enriched with unstable genes will be sensitive to passage and targeting these pathways might result in inconsistent drug response across passages., Our analysis shows that the pathways in the Hallmark gene set (47) have positive enrichment scores indicating high stability of these pathways across passages (Sup- plementary Data File S3)., For the Reactome gene set (31) we found that posttranscriptional mRNA processing pathways such as mRNA 30end processing and mRNA splicing are enriched with unstable genes (Fig., 3B; Supplementary Data File S4). It is well established that during proliferation and differentiation cellsadjust the mRNA and protein level by controlling the posttran- scriptional mRNA processing pathways (48 50)., Therefore the instability of these posttranscriptional mRNA-processing path- ways might be attributed to the tumor growth in the PDX., Targeting these pathways using a drug in PDXs might result in inconsistent response at different passages., In vivo biomarker discovery One of the main goals of pharmacogenomic studies is to find genomic biomarkers for drug response prediction., We evaluated the association between a molecular feature and response to a given drug (gene drug association) in PDXE (17) data., The PDXE data consists of a 1 /C21/C21 experimental design where 60 compounds were tested across 277 PDXs., The Xeva function plotPDX provides an interface for the visualization of time versus tumor volume data of PDXs., To model the tumor growth curve and to quantify the response of PDXs we implemented several drug response metric including slope,  area between curves, linear mixed effects model (28),  BAR,  and mRECIST (17)., We used Xeva to identify biomarkers for drug response pre- diction by computing gene drug associations for drugs in the PDXE data and their corresponding known biomarker genes defined using OncoKB resource (32)., For the analysis a PDX's response to a drug is de fined using BAR and association was computed using concordance index., Analysis was done for each tissue type with gene expression, CNA, and mutation data. In vitro drug testing has shown that the drug encorafenib can produce synergistic effects with binimetinib in cutaneous mela- noma (17, 51)., This drug combination also shows synergistic effects in PDXs as 50% of tested PDXs show tumor shrinkage, whereas binimetinib and encorafenib monotherapy show tumor shrinkage in 40% and 25% of PDXs, respectively (Fig., 4A and B). For the drug combination of encorafenib and binimetinib we found that NRAS mutation status is signi ficantly associated with response (Wilcoxon tests, FDR 140.01,  Fig., 4C). Among PDXs with NRAS wild-type status, 63.6% show a negative BAR to the Table 1.

This gene belongs to theMAP2K kinase family and produces a protein that activates the MAPK/ERK pathway., Associations between potential biomarkers and PDX drug response for all tissue types can be found in Supplementary Data File S5., To gain understanding of the association between drug response and target pathway we performed gene set enrich- ment analysis (Fig., 6). Drugs were classi fied into 11 classes according to their known targets and the Reactome pathway database was used for gene set enrichment analysis., We found that EGFR signaling in cancer pathway is signi ficantly enriched (FDR <0.05) in the EGFR class of drugs., Similarly for MAPK class drugs, relevant pathways such as MAPK activation in Toll-like receptor (TLR) cascade and NF- kBa n d MAPK activation by TLR are signi ficantly enriched (FDR < 0.05)., Associations between each drug and reactome pathways can be found in Supplementary Data File S6. Discussion PDXs are valuable models for cancer modeling and pharma- cogenomic analysis. However the translational potential of PDX preclinical models is highly dependent on the tools and techni- ques to processing and analyzing the data., Computational tools that enable standardized processing are thus an integral part of this line of research, and harmonized approaches can provide the community with accessible means for the analysis., The Xeva platform allows researchers to visualize and analyze the complex pharmacogenomic data generated during in vivo drug-screening studies., The key strengths of the Xeva platform is its ability to store all metadata from a PDX experiment link genomic data to corresponding PDX models,  and provide user friendly functions for analysis., In a recent study Ben-David and colleagues (45) analyzed changes in CNAs during PDX passaging using experimental and computational inferred copy number alterations (CNA) from gene expression pro files., They concluded that the CNA landscape of PDXs changes rapidly with passage as within four passages 12.3% (median) of the genome was affected by model-acquired CNAs., Although such an analysis is an important component of credentialing PDX as a preclinical platform their analysis depended largely on inference rather than direct measurement of CNAs, for 84% (933 of 1, 110) of PDX samples, the CNAs were inferred from microarray-based gene expression data and lack matched normal tissue samples., As the authors stated virtual karyotyping does not fully recapitulate the CNA observed from SNP microarrays or whole-exome sequencing., For the samples where DNA-based CNA pro files are available the authors have reported a concordance of 0.82 between experimental (DNA- based) and expression-based inferred CNA pro file., However directly assessing the gene expression pattern can provide better insight about changes in genomic landscape of PDXs across passages than the CNA pro file., In this study, using Xeva, we have assessed the gene expression landscape of PDXs. Our results indicate that the gene expression landscape of PDXs is similar across different passages as the correlation between the related PDXs is very high., At the level of individual genes we observe high consistency in expression patterns for the majority of genes., However, caution is required when analyzing genes with low stability in PDX models. Lack of stability in gene expression may lead to inconsistent results when targeting proteins or pathways related to genes with low expression stability., We50050100ResponseBinimetinib (FDR = 9.16 102) A 1000100200ResponseEncorafenib (FDR = 1.31 102) B 10050050100ResponseEncorafenib + Binimetinib (FDR = 1.31 102) C NRAS Mutation Wild type Figure 4., Xeva facilitates biomarker discovery and visualization.

Association between mutation and drug response was calculated using Xeva function drugSensitivitySig and FDR correction was applied to Pvalues., For visualization, waterfall function in Xeva is used.Mer et al. Cancer Res 79(17) September 1,  2019 Cancer Research 4546Downloaded from http, //aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/79/17/4539/2780767/4539.pdf by University Health Network user on 20 November 2023 have provided a list of genes and their stability score that will help researchers to assess the consistency in expression patterns of genes of interest and thereby deciding if PDXs are suitable models for their (targeted) drug of interest or to study behavior of a particular gene., In our study we found that the multiple known biomarkers predictive of drug response can be identi fied in the large Novartis PDXE dataset., Notably the dataset used in this study has the 1 /C21 /C21 PDX experiment design (Supplementary Fig., S4). Thus our results demonstrate that the 1 /C21/C21 PDX experiment design is an adequate way to discover drug response predicting biomarkers at the population level., Although the 1 /C21/C21 experiment design is a cost- and animal-resource ef ficient way to find biomarkers, using Xeva, we have found cases where control (untreated) mice show a partial response (PR) or tumor shrinkage., Possible causes of such early tumor shrinkage might include experimental errorhandling glitches, or genetic properties of the tumor., In a 1 /C21/C21 experiment design lack of replicates makes it impossible to decipher the exact cause., Visualization and analysis of PDX response data using Xeva provides an ef ficient way to recognize such cases., For biomarker discovery analysis, treatment response in PDXs is defined by the BAR (17). This metric of treatment response provides a continuous value however, it does not take into account the control arm of the PDX experiment., As PDX-based pharmacogenomics gains popularity standardized metrics to define response are required, thereby taking into account the control arm of the PDX experiments., Such methods will also improve the biomarker discovery process. Xeva provides a stan- dard tool for comparison of different PDX response metrics. The Xeva package enables easy and ef ficient analysis of the PDX-based pharmacogenomic data. Xeva includes functions to Figure 5. PDXs faithfully recapitulate known gene drug associations. For the breast cancer PDXE dataset the left side of the figure shows mutation (top),  CNA (middle), and expression (bottom) pattern of known biomarker genes., Here, each column represents genomic features from an individual PDX model. The right pane l shows association (concordance index) between genomic features and response of the drug., Columns represent drugs for which names are annotated on th e top. In this panel, the association between gene feature and drug is represented using circles. For drugs the corresponding biomarker is highlighte d using dark gray color if the association is statistically signi ficant (FDR <0.05)., Association between genomic feature and drug response was computed using the Xeva function drugSensitivitySig and visualization was done using ComplexHeatmap.Analysis of Patient-Derived Xenografts www.aacrjournals.org Cancer Res, 79(17) September 1,  2019 4547Downloaded from http, //aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/79/17/4539/2780767/4539.pdf by University Health Network user on 20 November 2023 link molecular features to drug response, therefore providing a unified framework for analysis and development of biomarkers of drug response., We developed the Xeva package to facilitate visualization analysis, and biomarker discovery in PDX pharmacogenomic data., We showed that PDX gene expression is consistent across passages. Our platform allowed us to con firm the existence ofseveral drug response prediction biomarkers in a large PDX pharmacogenomic dataset., The reproducibility of known bio- markers and consistency in gene expression shows that PDX experiments are suitable for in vivo biomarker discovery or validation., Xeva is an open-source flexible, and timely tool in an era of increasing efforts to use PDXs as the main model system for cancer research., We envision Xeva will play a crucial role in Figure 6. Pathways targeted by drugs are signi ficantly enriched in PDXs. In the circos plot drug classes (left) and targeted pathways (right) are linked when the association is signi ficant (gene set enrichment analysis, FDR <0.05)., Activity of EGFR class drugs has signi ficant association with EGFR signaling pathway. Similarly MAPK class drugs show signi ficant association with MAPK activation-related pathways.Mer et al., Cancer Res 79(17) September 1,  2019 Cancer Research 4548Downloaded from http, //aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/79/17/4539/2780767/4539.pdf by University Health Network user on 20 November 2023 PDX-based pharmacogenomic analysis, biomarker discovery,  and validation., Disclosure of Potential Con flicts of Interest No potential con flicts of interest were disclosed.

      "answer": "The abstract of the paper titled \"Integrative Pharmacogenomics Analysis of Patient-Derived Xenografts\" discusses the challenges in identifying reliable biomarkers for drug response in precision medicine. It highlights the emergence of patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX) as effective preclinical models that better mimic tumor responses to therapies. The authors introduce a new open-source software, Xenograft Visualization & Analysis (Xeva), designed to analyze high-throughput molecular and pharmacologic data from PDXs. The study reveals that only a limited number of genes and pathways show passage-specific changes, making them unsuitable for biomarker discovery. Utilizing the largest PDX pharmacogenomic dataset, the authors identify 87 pathways significantly linked to responses to 51 drugs. They also discover novel biomarkers based on gene expression, copy number variations, and mutations that predict drug responses. The findings demonstrate that Xeva is a valuable tool for integrative analysis of pharmacogenomic data, advancing the field of precision oncology by aiding in the identification of predictive biomarkers for drug response."

      "answer": "The methodology used in the paper \"Integrative Pharmacogenomics Analysis of Patient-Derived Xenografts\" involves several key steps and components aimed at analyzing pharmacogenomic data from patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX). Here is a detailed description of the methodology:\n\n1. **Data Acquisition**: The researchers obtained gene expression data, PDX passages, and tissue information from the Gene Expression Omnibus and relevant publications. They specifically utilized the largest PDX pharmacogenomic dataset available, which included molecular profiles such as mutations, copy number aberrations (CNA), and gene expression data.\n\n2. **Data Processing**: \n   - Gene expression profiles were normalized using the Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) algorithm from the Affy package in Bioconductor.\n   - PDX passages and tissue information were curated manually, and the data were processed using R statistical software.\n   - The final dataset comprised 3,470 unique PDX models tested across 57 treatments from 191 patients across five different cancer types.\n\n3. **Xeva Software Development**: The authors developed an open-source software package called Xenograft Visualization & Analysis (Xeva) to facilitate the storage, access, and analysis of in vivo pharmacogenomics data.

      "question": "How does the paper address potential biases in the research?",
      "answer": "The paper addresses potential biases in the research primarily through the following strategies:\n\n1. **Use of Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDX)**: The authors emphasize that PDX models are more representative of human tumors compared to traditional immortalized cell lines, which often exhibit significant genomic alterations due to artificial culture conditions. By utilizing PDX models, the study aims to minimize biases associated with the artificial environment of cell lines.\n\n2. **Standardization of Data Reporting**: The research adheres to the PDX-MI (Minimal Information for Patient-Derived Xenograft Models) standards, which ensure that all necessary clinical attributes and experimental details are reported. This standardization helps mitigate biases related to data collection and interpretation.\n\n3. **Systematic Analysis of Gene Expression Across Passages**: The study systematically analyzes gene expression patterns across different passages of PDXs to assess stability. By calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for gene expression, the authors identify which genes exhibit stable expression across passages, thereby addressing potential biases related to variability in gene expression that could affect drug response.\n\n4. **Comparison of Experimental Designs**: The paper discusses the limitations of the 1:1 experimental design (testing each compound in only one PDX model per patient) which could introduce biases due to lack of replicates. The authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest that while this design is cost-effective for high-throughput screening, it may be more prone to experimental errors. They propose that both this design and replicate-based designs should coexist, depending on the research goals.\n\n5. **Robust Statistical Analysis**: The authors employ various statistical measures, such as the concordance index (CI) and false discovery rate (FDR) adjustments, to assess the significance of gene-drug associations. This rigorous statistical approach helps to reduce biases in the interpretation of results.\n\n6. **Transparency and Reproducibility**: The study emphasizes the importance of making the Xeva platform open-source and available for public use, which enhances transparency and allows other researchers to reproduce the analysis and validate findings, thereby addressing biases related to data interpretation and analysis.\n\nOverall, the paper takes a comprehensive approach to identify and mitigate potential biases in the research through methodological rigor, adherence to standards, and transparency in data handling and analysis."

      "question": "Are there any contradictions between this paper's findings and previous research?",
      "answer": "Yes, there are contradictions between the findings of this paper and previous research. The paper presents evidence that the gene expression landscape of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) is consistent across different passages, indicating stability in gene expression patterns. This finding contrasts with a meta-analysis by Ben-David et al. (2017), which suggested that the genomic landscape of PDXs changes rapidly during passaging, particularly in terms of copy number alterations (CNA). \n\nThe authors of the current study argue that their direct assessment of gene expression patterns provides better insight into the stability of PDX models compared to the inferred CNAs used in the previous study. They highlight that while their results show high consistency in gene expression for the majority of genes across passages, caution is warranted for genes with low stability, which may lead to inconsistent drug response results.\n\nThus, the current study challenges the conclusions drawn by Ben-David et al. regarding the rapid changes in the genomic landscape of PDXs during passaging, suggesting instead that gene expression remains stable across passages, which is critical for the reliability of PDX models in drug response prediction."
