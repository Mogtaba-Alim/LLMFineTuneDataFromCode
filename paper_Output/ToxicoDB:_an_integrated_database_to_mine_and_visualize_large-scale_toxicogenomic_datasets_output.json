Inter-laboratory comparisons investi- gating the variability induced by the heterogeneity of ex- perimental and data analysis protocols have been reported(12)., Inter- and intra-laboratory reproducibility study of in vitrotoxicogenomicsshowpromisingresultswithconsistent replication of the results ( 12)., Reproducibility of key path- ways involved in response to chemical stress across species has also been studied ( 13)., Even though there has been a spikeintheuseofgenomicdatafortoxicityprediction dataavailability by itself is not promising., The disparate nature ofthesedatasetsandhigh-dimensionalgeneexpressionpro- fileshinderintegrativeandreproducibleanalysisofthedata.Several roadblocks such as differences in experimental de- sign, use of ambiguous compound and gene annotations, lack of unified statistical methods limit fitness of the data., Considerableeffortsarethereforerequiredforhomogenous pre-processingofthedatabeforemeaningfulanalysiscouldcommence., To address these issues we have developed ToxicoDB , a web-application integrating three large in vitrotoxicoge- nomicdatasets., ToxicoDB offersanintuitiveinterfacetoex- plorethesedatasets byproviding curated compound anno- tations, humanandratgeneidentifiers, andvisualizationoftime- and dose-dependent chemical effects on genes., Thesedatasets contain 6597 experiments for 231 chemical com- pounds.ToxicoDB users can view analyze, and download differential gene expression and visualize enriched path- ways for compounds of interest., Additionally users candownloadnormalizedgeneexpressionvaluesalongwithex- perimentalmetadataforuser-definedanalysis.Here, wede- scribe the content,  pre-processing and web-interface (Fig-ure1)., METHODS Toxicogenomic datasets and statistics ToxicoDB incorporates large in vitro toxicogenomic datasets such as Open TG-GATEs and DrugMatrix., Todate we have curated three datasets,  (i) Primary human hepatocyte from Open TG-GATEs (TGH), (ii) rat hepa- tocyte from Open TG-GATEs (TGR),  (iii) DrugMatrix(DM)., The microarray data in TGH and TGR were down- loaded from theLife ScienceDatabase Archive( dbarchive., biosciencedbc.jp/en/open-tggates/download.html ) along with metadata and viability measurements. Biological molecules and compounds for which there was an ambi- guity in concentration were excluded from the curation.Currently, TGH and TGR datasets contain 146 and 140 compounds,  respectively., For DM raw files and metadata for 125 chemical compounds have been obtained from thediXa Data Warehouse ( wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/fg/dixa/ ), study ID DIXA-033, an initiative developing a single resource to collect data produced by toxicogenomics studies ( 14)., Probes were mapped to unique genes using the latest Brainarray CDF (version 24) for human and rat. Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) from the R affypackage (version 1.62.0) has been used for batch normalization (15)., Genes were mapped to Ensembl gene IDs using the latest version (Ensembl Release 99). Entrez gene ID and otherattributesweremappedusingtheR biomaRt package (version 2.40.5) for both human and rat ( 16)., Differential gene expression for experiments at all concentrations and time points have been performed using the R Limma package (version 3.40.6) ( 17)., The normalized data was integrated into ToxicoSets (TSet) using our R package ToxicoGx and can also be downloaded directly from the ToxicoDB webserver along withmetadata., Integration of the toxicogenomics datasets in ToxicoGx To provide a unified framework for easy downloading and analysisoftoxicogenomicdatasets, wedevelopedanR Tox- icoGxpackage( github.com/bhklab/ToxicoGx )whereinraw data was accessed and extensively curated in-house and in- tegrated as a new R object called ToxicoSet (TSet, Sup-plementary Figure S1)., A TSet efficiently stores molecular profiles(geneexpressionuponcompoundexposure) viabil- ityassays(cytotoxicity), andmetadata.CellviabilityvaluesfromOpenTG-GATEsincludetwotypesofassaystoevalu- atecytotoxicity, lactatedehydrogenaseassayandDNAcon- tentofcells.ATSetcanbedownloadedtoaccessthemolec-ular profiles of all experimental conditions, detailed cura- tionobjectsforcompounds, andcellviabilitymeasurements NucleicAcidsResearch, 2020, Vol.48, WebServerissue W457 Figure 1., Schematic overview of ToxicoDB .

ToxicoGx provides a suite of func- tionsforsummarizingcomplexexperimentsandcomputing compound-geneassociationsthatallowuserstoanalyzethe dataconveniently., Semi-automated curation and annotation of chemical com- pound identifiers Tomaintainconsistencyandtomaximizetheoverlapacross datasets, we developed a semi-automated curation of com-poundnames.Firstly, compoundnameshavebeenchecked for exact case-insensitive matches against already curated unique compound names from PubChem., Names that didnotmatchinthefirststepweresubjectedtopartialmatching withcompoundsynonymsobtainedfromPubChem( 18)or DrugBank ( 19)., For the remaining unmapped compounds SMILES,  InChIKeys, or PubChem identifiers were used for mapping to human-readable names., Annotations of 58 compounds based on invitroandinvivogenotoxic (GTX) and non-genotoxic (NGTX) carcinogenicity have been ob- tainedfrom OpenRiskNet ( 20) (SupplementaryTable S1)., Gene-setenrichment analysis and gene-sets To analyze pathways associated with compound-induced gene expression changes, Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)wasperformedusingthe runGSAfunctionoftheR Pianopackage (version 2.0.2) ( 21)., Biological Process (BP) Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Reactome (C2) pathways were downloaded using the R msigdbr package (version 7.0.1) to maintain consistency between the human and ratGMTfiles( 22).Pathwaysassociatedwithtoxicityhavebeen downloaded from Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD)forReactome and KEGG (April 2020 release).Cross-dataset dose levelselection The cross-dataset correlation for 45 common compounds between TGR and DM were analyzed using the ToxicoGx package (version 1.0.0) in R (version 3.6.1)., The drugPer- turbationSig function was used to model compound signa- tures. This function returns the estimated linear model co- efficient for the effect of compound concentration on geneexpression and associated statistics ( t-statistics and signifi- cance).BothTGRandDMprovidedgeneexpressionmea- surements at three dose levels (low, middle,  high),  and re-ported the associated concentrations used., Compound sig- natures were estimated for all three dose levels. The Spear- mancorrelationsforthesignaturesofthesamecompoundsacrossthetwodatasetswerecomputedforallpossiblepairs of dose levels computed, and are reported in Supplemen- tary Table S2., For subsequent analysis the dose level foreachcompoundwaschosensuchthatitminimizedtheabso- luteconcentrationdifferencebetweenthetwostudies.Com- pound signatures were filtered for genes with a significantfalsediscoveryrate(FDR <0.05)inatleastonecompound inoneorbothdatasets, andSpearmancorrelationsbetween allcompoundsignaturesinthetwodatasetswerecomputed.Theeffectoftheabsolutevalueoftheconcentrationdiffer- enceonthestrengthofcompoundsignaturecorrelationbe- tween the two datasets was assessed in two different ways, theSpearmanrankcorrelationtestwasdonebetweenexact absolute values of concentration differences and the corre- lation of the same compounds across the two studies, andthe absolute values of concentration differences were cate- gorizedintothreecategories, x20/H9262M, 20 /H9262M<x1000 /H9262M, x>1000/H9262M, with a KruskalWallis rank sum test applied to detect differences in location of the same com- pound correlation distributions across the three categories (SupplementaryFigure S3)., W458NucleicAcidsResearch,2020,Vol.48,WebServerissue Figure 2.

WEB DEVELOPMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE Web implementation and API Theapplicationconsistsofthreelayers thefront-end /client layer,  the backend /server layer and the database layer., The clientlayerimplementationinReact(version16.11.0)guar- antees fast rendering and high performance, while data isbeing organized and visualized in the form of plots and tables.ToxicoDB tables allow users to download data in CSVformatasspreadsheets.Renderingoftheplotsisdonewith d3.js (version 5) and ReactPlotlyJS (version 2.4.0), which are both JavaScript libraries for interactive and dy- namic visualization built on HTML, CSS,  and SVG., Thebackend /server layer is built using Node (version 10.16.0) and Express (version 4.17.1) with Representational State Transfer (RESTful) architecture., Knex.js (version 0.20.1)has been used as a SQL query builder to interact with the databaselayeroftheapp.Thedatabaselayerisimplemented asarelationaldatabaseinMySQLwithInnoDBstorageen- gine (version 5.7)., The schema for the ToxicoDB database is provided in SupplementaryFigure S2.All components of the web application are hosted on Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure that providesPaaS (Platform as a Service) solutions to simplify ap- plication management and ensures an increased level of security, performance and flexibility., The web appli-cation leverages two Azure PaaS server resources. The Node server is deployed under Azure Web App Service while the database server is using Azure Database forMySQL Server Service solution to support large batch queries against multiple tables, ACID (atomicity,  consis- tency,  isolation,  durability) compliance and transactionalsupport., ToxicoDB provides a RESTful API (Application Pro- gramming Interface) that users may use directly toquery the database and receive data in JSON for- mat without using a web app interface (Supplemen- tary Data)., This provides a lot of flexibility for otherdevelopers to programmatically retrieve and use the most recent version of the data available in ToxicoDB and integrate it into their own software or automatedsolutions., NucleicAcidsResearch2020, Vol.48, WebServerissue W459 Toxicogenomic dataavailability and data access The curated datasets are available as ToxicoSet (TSet) objects on Zenodo, Open TG-GATEs human (DOI,  10.5281 /zenodo.3762812),  Open TG-GATEs rat (DOI, 10.5281 /zenodo.3762817),  and DrugMatrix (DOI,  10.5281 /zenodo.3766569)., Documentation and open-source code TheToxicoDB code is open-source and publicly available on GitHub ( github.com/bhklab/ToxicoDB-web )., TheTox- icoDBweb application is documented with examples of usecasesandsynonym-basedsearch chemicalcompounds,  genes,  datasets,  and pathways summary pages available., It alsodetailstheannotationandanalysispagesforindividualchemical compounds genes,  and datasets, as well as gene expression visualization pages with explanations of how to interpret the data., The roadmap for additional datasets inthe pipeline is listed in the documentation. The documen- tationcan be foundat http://toxicodb.ca/documentation/ . WEB-INTERFACE AND ANALYSIS ToxicoDB search The main way to interact with ToxicoDB is through its search interface., The search bar found on the homepage of the website allows users to query the data contained in thedatabase, andfunctionsasthemainnavigationtoolaround the web app., All chemical compounds genes, datasets and pathwayanalysiscanbeaccessedbyclickingontherespec-tive links on the top right corner of the front page., For simplicity we implemented an intuitive search interface to query a compound or gene of interest., A plain search ofa gene or compound name (or synonyms) shows both hu- man and rat data. A pairwise compound-gene query can be used when users seek to visualize the dataset-specific ef-fect of a compound on the gene implicated in a toxic re- sponse.Thesearchbarisaugmentedwithauto-completion which lets users know of the existence of that entity in thedatabase.Thepathwaysenrichedbycompoundsofinterest can be queried separately in the Pathways page of the web- application., Analysis of differential gene expression induced by ac- etaminophen in primary human hepatocytes For this study, acetaminophen,  a widely used analgesic antipyretic agent, which is also classified as Most-DILI (Drug-Induced-Liver-Injury)-Concern drug by FDA, was queried in the search bar or selected from the list of all chemical compounds which directs to the compound page., This page starts with annotations of the compoundsuch as PubChem CID linking to the database SMILES, InChIKeys,  carcinogenicity classification,  and synonyms used across datasets., The top differentially expressed genescomputed using limmaare presented using a volcano plot for all datasets (Figure 2A)., The significant genes are high- lighted in green where the absolute value of the log 2-fold- change is >1 and the FDR is <0.05., The name of the sig- nificant genes is visible upon hovering over the clickabledots. The same data is presented in a tabular, download- able format for user-defined analysis. For this study we soughttoanalyzetheeffectofacetaminophen(datadown- loaded for the highest dose and 24 h time point) on theCytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in the TGH dataset., All otherdosesandtimecombinationsareavailablefortheuser for visualization as well as analysis. CYP is a superfam-ily of heme-proteins that carry out oxidative metabolism of many endogenous and foreign compounds ( 23)., Studies haveimplicatedtheeffectofCYPenzymesonbioactivationofacetaminophen( 24 25)Weobservedthatacetaminophen downregulatestheexpressionofcertainCYPenzymessuch asCYP2C8, CYP2C19comparedtoCYP1A1andCYP1B1(Figure2B)., The Search interface also provides a line plot to visualize the time- and dose-dependent effect of the ac- etaminophen on genes ofinterest(Figure 2C)., Effect of DNA synthesis inhibitors on toxicity-related path- ways Thepathwayssectionof ToxicoDB providesaccesstopath- way enrichment analysis of the toxicity signatures for eachcompound, computed as described in the corresponding methods section., This page has four subquery sections en- abling the selection of a dataset chemical compounds of choice, ontologies such as GO and Reactome (MSigDB) as well as Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), and finally a list of pathway names., In order to analyze the effect of certain DNA synthesis inhibitors on com- pound metabolism cellular stress,  and cell cycle, com-pounds from TGH were selected to query in the Path- ways section of ToxicoDB ., Azathioprine Colchicine,  Cy- clophosphamide,  Doxorubicin, Etoposide and N-methyl- N-nitrosourea were queried for MSigDB Reactome path- ways (Figure 3)., The pathways related to cell cycle and DNAreplicationweredownregulatedwhereaspathwaysas-sociated with cytochrome P450, cellular response to stress, and metabolism of xenobiotic compounds were upregu- lated with exceptions to Cyclophosphamide., This trendaligns with the studies discussing xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes and their role in activation and detoxification of chemicals( 26)aswellasoxidativestressinducedbychemi- cal compounds ( 27, 28)., Cross-dataset correlation analysis of TGR and DM using ToxicoGx To check the consistency between TGR and DM rat pri- maryhepatocytedata , wecomparedchemical-inducedgene expressionchangesinbothdatasets(seeMETHODS).The union of genes significant in both studies was selected toavoid bias and was used for further analysis., To check if there are consistent signatures between the two datasets we computed the rank-based correlation of the differen-tially expressed genes (coefficients estimated using Toxi- coGx, Figure4A) for the closest compound-specific doses betweendatasets.Amongthetopchemicalcompoundsthatwerefoundtobecorrelatedbetweenthedatasets, Cisplatin,  a widely used chemotherapeutic agent ( 29), showed the highestcorrelation(Figure 4C)whereasGemfibrozil, aper- oxisomeproliferator-activatedreceptoralpha(PPARA)in- hibitor (30) was the least correlated., We further compared W460NucleicAcidsResearch,2020,Vol.48,WebServerissue Figure 3.

MoAviz ( 31) allows visualization of perturbed pathways using the data from Open TG-GATEs and DrugMatrix., It uses a metric Modified Jaccard Index (MJI) for the quantitative descrip-tion of pathway similarity to evaluate the extent of associ- ation of gene expression changes with mode of action., The interfaceallowssearchofdatasetsandcompoundsandpro-vides a quantitative description of genomic pathway sim- ilarity., Toxygates ( 32) was originally released as an inter- face to increase the accessibility of Open TG-GATEs., Cur-rently it provides an orthologous mode for data compari- son among different species, interactive clustering,  enrich- mentanalysis, anduserdatauploading.CollaborativeTox- icogenomics (CTox) ( 33) is an integrated web portal for gene expression analysis in safety studies wherein the re-sults can be compared to Open TG-GATEs and DrugMa- trix., Users can describe their experiments upload the cor- responding samples, evaluate their results using a varietyofestablishedandemergingsystemsbiologyanalysismeth- ods., LTmap ( 34) compares signatures of query compounds against pre-generated signatures from Open TG-GATEs., WhileMoAvizToxygates, CToxandLTmapprovidedif- ferent platforms for dataset integration, ToxicoDB pro- vides consistent standardized identifiers for compoundsand genes, unlike the existing databases., The source pack- ageToxicoGx coupledwith ToxicoDB providesanexcellent platform for power users who wish to further analyze the NucleicAcidsResearch, 2020, Vol.48, WebServerissue W461 Figure 4., Cross-dataset analysis between TGR and DM using Spearman correlation.

ToxicoDB has potential limitations in terms of inclusion of model systems.
