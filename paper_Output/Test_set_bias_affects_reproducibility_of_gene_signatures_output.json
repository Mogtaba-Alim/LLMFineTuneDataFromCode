From a biomedical perspective this implies that predictions for a single patient may change depending on which other patient samples they are normalized with., This test set bias willoccur when any cross-sample normalization is used before clinical prediction. Results We demonstrate that results from existing gen e signatures which rely on normalizing test data may be irreproducible when the patient population changes composition or size using a set ofcurated, publicly available breast cancer microarra y experiments., As an alternative we examine the use of gene signatures that rely on ranks from the d ata and show why signature s using rank-based fea- tures can avoid test set bias while maintaining highl y accurate classification, even across platforms., Availability and implementation  The code, data and instructions necessary to reproduce our entire analysis is available at https, //github.com/prpatil/testsetbias., Contact  jtleek@gmail.com or bhaibeka@uhnresearch.ca Supplementary information , Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online., 1 Introduction One of the most common barriers to the development and transla- tion of genomic signatures is cross-sample variation in technology, normalization and laboratories ( Majewski and Bernards,  2011 )., Technology batch and sampling artifacts have been responsible forthe failure of genomic signatures ( Baggerly et al., 2005 , Petricoin et al.,  2002 ),  irreproducibility of genomic results ( Michiels et al., , 2005 ) and retraction of papers reporting genomic signatures (Sebastiani et al. , 2010 ). Even highly successful signatures such as Mammaprint ( vant Veer et al. 2002 ) have required platform- specific retraining before they could be translated to clinical use(Glas et al., , 2006 ). An under-appreciated source of bias in genomic signatures is test set bias ( Lusa et al. , 2007 ). Test set bias occurswhen the predictions for any single patient depend on the data for other patients in the test set., For example suppose that the gene ex-pression data for a single patient is normalized by subtracting themean expression and dividing by the standard deviation of the ex-pression across all patients in the test set., Then the normalized valuefor any specific gene for that patient depends on the values for allthe patients they are normalized with., The result is that a patientmay get two different predictions using the same data and the sameprediction algorithm, depending on the other patients used to nor-malize the test set data ( Fig., 1 ). There are many scenarios under which a patients classification ought to change if new information updates or alters the predictionalgorithm or if the raw, biological patient data itself changes., VCThe Author 2015.

Additionally, methods such as quantile normalization and other for ms of data scaling and transform- ation have become well known in the field and are often applied asstandard steps in a data processing pipeline., Even if single sample normalization methods were universally available public measures of gene expression are frequently pre-processed using a range of methods for cleaning, normalization andanalysis, resulting in a range of expression values for the same geneacross different platforms ( Allison et al., , 2006 ). A more tractable solution is to build gene signatures that do not rely on raw geneexpression values. We propose using the ranks of genes instead oftheir raw expression values under the assumption that any trans-formation applied to the data is rank-preserving.As a concrete example, we focus on the PAM50 signature for breast cancer subtyping ( Parker et al.,  2009 ), which is used to assign patients with breast cancer to one of five molecular subtypes,  Basal, Luminal A,  Luminal B,  Her2 and Normal., We show that when thenumber of patients in the test set changes the predictions for a singlepatient may change dramatically., We also show that variation in pa-tient populations being predicted upon leads to test set bias.Interestingly, PAM50 can be easily modified into a rank-based sig-nature., We show that predictions from rank-based PAM50 are com-parable to those from standard PAM50 and that predictions fromrank-based PAM50 are invariant to test set bias., Test set bias is a failure of reproducibility of a genomic signature. In other words the same patient,  wi th the same data and classification algorithm, may be assigned to different clinical groups., A similar failingresulted in the cancellation of clinical trials that used an irreproduciblegenomic signature to make chemotherapy decisions ( The Cancer Letter, 2011 )., The implications of a patients classification changing due to test set bias may be important clinically, financially and legally.In the example of PAM50, a patients classification could affect a treat-ment or therapy decision., In other cases an estimation of the patientsprobability of survival may be too opt imistic or pessimistic., The funda- mental issue is that the patients predicted quantity should be fullydetermined by the patients genomic information, and the bias we willexplore here is induced completely due to technical steps., 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Study population and data We collected and curated gene expression microarray data representing 28 independent studies ( Haibe-Kains et al., , 2012 ). These datasets Fig. 1. A description of how test set bias can alter class prediction for an individual patient. In ( a), we learn a model for predicting if a patient is in class R (red) or class B (blue). In our training data the patients with darker gray features tend to be in class B, whereas the lighter gray patients are in class R. We develop a prediction rule from our training data and apply it to a new darker gray patient, and we see that he is likely to be classified to class B., In ( b) we attempt to classify a single patient in the context of two different patient populations., We see that depending on the number and type of other patients in the population when we normalize the data, the resulting feature profile for our patient can be drastically different., This leads to different eventual classifications by our prediction rule. We co ntend that the ultimate classification of a patient should not depend on the characteristics of the test set but rather solely on the characteristics of the patient himselfTest set bias 2319 spanned 15 different proprietary platform types and a variety of plat- form versions and included a range o f commercial and private manufac- turers, spanning Affymetrix,  Illumina and Agilent as well as customarrays., The data were collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus(Barrett et al. , 2013 ), ArrayExpress ( Parkinson et al. 2007 ) The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill database (UNCDB), Stanford Microarray Database (SMD) and Journal and Authors web-sites., Metadata were manually curated as previously described ( Haibe- Kains et al., 2012 ). Experiments ranged from 43 to 1992 patients with a median of 131 patients and a total of 6297 patients ( Table 1 )., 2.2 PAM model fitting Prediction analysis of microarrays (PAM) ( Tibshirani et al. 2002 )i s a commonly used supervised learning approach for building predic-tion models using gene expression data from microarrays., We em-ployed the pamr package ( Hastie et al. 2014 ) to fit a PAM model using R. Briefly pamr takes class labels and microarray data andcalculates an average gene expression profile, or centroid,  for eachclass., It then shrinks the centroid to eliminate genes that do not con-tribute to explaining variability between classes., We thencross-validate to find an appropriate shrinkage threshold to maxi- mize predictive accuracy of our model., We use this threshold to de-termine how many of the genes to keep in the predictor. 2.3 Normalization procedure Normalization is accomplished through quantile rescaling as imple-mented in the genefu package ( Haibe-Kains et al., 2011 )., This scales each gene expression value xusing specific quantiles from the ex- pression data. First, a quantile qis chosen. Through examination of many microarray datasets, q140.05 was found to be robust. The expression values corresponding to the desired quantiles q 114xq 2and q214x1/C0q 2are defined and the scaled value x014x/C0q1 q2/C0q1is calculated., In contrast to scaling by the maximum and minimum value this ap- proach is more robust to extreme outlying gene expression values., This normalization procedure is applied internally when the in- trinsic.cluster.predict function from the genefu package is used andthe models standardization (std) parameter is set to robust., Forexample we can make PAM50 predictions using pre-packagedmodels in genefu called pam50 or pam50.robust., The gene centroidinformation is the same in both cases but pam50 has std 14none and pam50.robust has std 14robust., This means that if we apply in- trinsic.cluster.predict with pam50 the test data will not be normal-ized in any way, but if we use pam50.robust the quantile rescalingprocedure described above will be applied., 2.4 Estimating test set bias We used two approaches to estimate test set bias. When consideringthe PAM50 predictor we simply applied the pre-defined predictionmodel from the genefu package ( Haibe-Kains et al., , 2011 ) to make predictions on our data. To train a PAM model, we used 10-fold cross-validation. We create a test set that is approximately 10% of the total data and usethe remaining 90% to train the model., We use the internal cross-validation functions provided in the pamr package ( Hastie et al. 2014 ) to produce a shrinkage threshold and determine the number of genes necessary to make predictions., We then apply this predictorboth in the test set which comes from the same platform, and onother microarray datasets that used different platforms., This processis repeated within each of the cross-validation folds to get averageprediction accuracies and standard deviations., When predictingtumor grade (13 with increasing severity) we restricted to patientsgraded 1 or 3 as grade 2 is considered to be ambiguous., 3 Results 3.1 Normalization makes patient predictions depend on other patients data Consider the PAM50 signature ( Parker et al., , 2009 ). The class as- signment for a new patient is made by calculating a measure ofcloseness between the new patient and the average patient profile ineach possible class, then choosing the class that was closest to thesample., For example PAM50 consists of 50 genes and predicts fiveclasses, so each class centroid is a profile of the average expressionof each of the 50 genes within that class., The authors used correl-ation as a measure of closeness for a given sample to each class cen-troid i.e., correlation is calculated between the 50 genes in thepatient sample and the 50 genes in each class centroid., This is thestep that necessitates suitable rescaling of the test data before predic-tions are made. We considered two scenarios which illustrate how PAM50 can produce varying subtype predictions for a particular patient whenTable 1., Baseline characteristics of curated dataset Characteristic Summary N 6297 Age (years) 57.29 (13.42) RFS (years) 7.22 (4.86) Tumor size (cm) 2.52 (1.43)Node  1871  2857NA 1569 Grade a 1 5252 1642 3 2226NA 1904 ER  3635  1556 NA 1106 PGR  766  656 NA 4875 Her2  496  1437 NA 4364 Subtype b Basal 1254 Her2 927 LumA 2007 LumB 1813Normal 296 Her2, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status,  node, whether or not cancer has spread to lymph nodes,  PGR,  progesterone receptor status,  RFS, recurrence-free survival time., Age, RFS and tumor size are given as means with stand- ard deviations. aBecause of the ambiguity of grade 2 we chose to build all prediction models for grades 1 and 3 only., bSubtypes as predicted by PAM50.2320 P.Patil et al. the data for other patients used in normalization varies. We used data from GSE7390 ( n14198) an experiment conducted using the Affymetrix hgu133plus2 microarray., In each experiment we nor- malized the gene expression measurements in the test set to fall be- tween 0 and 1., First, we created predictions where we normalized all patients together. Then we calculated predictions for the same patientswhen normalized in smaller groups ( n14210, 20, 40, 80, 100, 120) and measured the agreement between the predictions for the exactsame patient when normalized with all patients versus a smaller sub-set of patients., When normalized in small batches the predictionsfor the same patient changed compared with the case where all pa-tients were normalized together ( Fig., 2 A). Next we predicted on patient populations that varied in the dis- tribution of estrogen receptor (ER) status, which is an important fac-tor in breast cancer prognosis and treatment., Again we applied thePAM50 predictor to the entire test set. Then we created subsets ofthe entire test set with differing percentages of ER-negative patientsand applied the predictor to each subset., When the percentage ofER-negative patients in the subset matched the percentage in theentire test set, patient subtypes best agreed with the original predic- tions on the entire test set., However when the ER status of the otherpatients in the test set varied, the predictions for the same patient were often different ( Fig., 2 B). 3.2 Using gene ranks with unnormalized data produces comparable accuracy When PAM50 was proposed the authors chose to calculate similar- ity based on Spearman correlation ( Parker et al., , 2009 ). Spearman correlation finds the correlation between the ranks of the two sets of gene expression measurements rather than correlation between theactual values., We hypothesized that this rank-based predictionwould be immune to some changes of scale across platforms andother platform-specific artifacts., With traditional signatures, theseare precisely the reasons why normalization is necessary. To exam-ine this preliminarily we re-ran the process from the previous sec-tion but simply did not normalize the data and relied on the internalrank-based correlation calculation., We recreated Figure 2 A and B when the data were unscaled. These appear as Supplementary Fig. 2. Predictions for an individual patient can change depending on how many and what type of patients are included in the normalization step., ( A) We first pre- dicted the PAM50 subtype on an entire set of patients (Affymetrix hgu133plus2 GSE7390,  n14198)., We then took 100 random samples of patient subsets ranging from 2 to 120 patients and predicted their subtypes with data normalization., We compared this newly predicted subtype to each patients originally pr edicted sub- type and calculated agreement., Actual data are jittered and overlayed on the boxplot. We find that there is significant variation in percent concordanc e when a small subset of patients is subtyped in comparison to the entire patient population., ( B) From the same setup we took 100 random samples each of 40 patients and varied the percentage of ER-positive and ER-negative patients in the sample., That is 0% on the X-axis corresponds to 0% (0/40) ER-negative patien ts and 100% (40/40) ER-positive patients in the sample., We then predicted subtypes on this subset and compared these newly predicted subtypes to the origina l predic- tions., The average concordance is plotted with 61SE bands. We note that the original population is 32% ER negative (dashed green line) which is where we see close to maximal concordanceTest set bias 2321 Figures SI and SII, and they show that the predictions remain con- stant as sample size and ER status vary when the data are unnormal-ized and a rank-based metric is employed., To further evaluate this hypothesis we used the previously pro- posed PAM signature-building procedure ( Tibshirani et al., 2002 ) to build a genomic signature to predict tumor grade (a clinical quan-tity indicating severity) using three datasets measured on differentplatforms, GSE7390 (Affymetrix,  n14198),  ISDB10845 (Agilent,  n14337) and ISDB10278 (Illumina,  n141992)., We used 10-fold cross-validation to train a model on a particular dataset made pre-dictions on the testing portion of that dataset and applied the trainedmodel to the two remaining datasets, which represent two differentplatforms., We averaged over the 10-folds in each case to obtainmean accuracy and standard deviation. To make predictions we used Spearman correlation to mimic how the PAM50 signature is used ( Parker et al.,  2009 )., We predicted new patient samples using our PAM signature for grade both withand without normalization., The same set of genes and predictionalgorithm are used in both casesthe only difference is that in theformer we normalize the test set patient data, and in the latter,  weleave it unnormalized., We observed that the normalized and un-normalized predictors performed similarly across platforms ( Fig., 3 ). Within-platform (Affy-Affy, Agilent-Agilent, Illumina-Illumina inFig. 3 ) there is no appreciable difference in the average accuracy of predictions when the test data are normalized or unnormalized.For Affy, the grade 1 and 3 average accuracies and standard devi-ations (represented by error bars in the figure) when the data are normalized are 0.92 (0.13) and 0.67 (0.17), respectively,  when com- pared with 0.92 (0.13) and 0.65 (0.16) when the data are unnormal-ized., For Agilent the relevant figures are 0.72 (0.32),  0.56 (0.05) fornormalized versus 0.72 (0.32), 0.65 (0.09) for unnormalized and forIllumina 0.92 (0.06),  0.65 (0.05) versus 0.84 (0.08), 0.71 (0.06)., Inall cases the ranges of the unnormalized average accuracies substan-tially overlap those of the normalized average accuracies., Resultsacross platforms (the off-diagonal grid entries in the figure) tell asimilar story. It is the case that if the scaled predictor performs betteron grade 1 than the unscaled then the opposite will be true for grade3 (see e.g., the Agilent-Illumina result). This is due to the fact that pa- tients can be classified as either grade 1 or 3 so if the unscaled ver-sion predicts more grade 3 than grade 1, the change in the respectiveaccuracies will be proportional., This analysis suggests that using thePAM predictor for grade with Spearman correlation and withoutnormalizing the test set data produces similar predictive accuracy towhen the test set data are normalized., 4 Discussion We found that breast cancer tumor subtype predictions varied forthe same patient when the data for that patient were processed usingdiffering numbers of patient sets and patient sets had varying distri-butions of key characteristics (ER status)., This is undesirable behav-ior for a prediction algorithm as the same patient should always beassigned the same prediction assuming their genomic data do notchange., The fact that sample size affects normalized data values isunsurprising but the fact that classifications varied by how manypatients were ER /C0in the test set speaks to the generalizability of an algorithm., Ideally the test set should be similar in composition tothe dataset upon which a classification algorithm was trained., Theresult in Figure 2 B is undoubtedly related to the fact that ER pa- tients are different in terms of gene expression from ER /C0patients, but we see that even slight perturbations in the ER composition ofthe subpopulation can affect patient classifications., This raises thequestion of how similar the test set needs to be to the training datafor classifications to be trusted when the test data are normalized., The PAM50 signature uses Spearman correlation to assess dis- tances when making predictions so we leveraged this by comparinghow a PAM signature using Spearman correlation predicts tumorgrade outcomes with and without normalization., We found the re-sults to be comparable but the unnormalized approach guaranteesthe same prediction for the same patient every time., A gene signa-ture that employs rank-based features or makes other rank-basedcalculations is one robust approach to avoiding test set bias., Although all gene signature classifiers do not necessarily have a Fig. 3. Average accuracy of scaled and unscaled predictions over different training and testing sets we trained a PAM model to predict tumor grade (either gra de 1 or 3) using 10-fold cross-validation on one Affymetrix (GSE7390), Agilent (ISDB10845) and Illumina (ISDB10278) dataset each., The rows represent u pon which platform each model was trained and the columns represent upon which platform each trained model was applied to make predictions., To get average accu racy and standard deviations (error bars) for a particular platform we use the model generated under each fold of the cross-validation to make prediction s on the re- maining test set of the same platform as well as the two other platforms., We applied this model after normalizing (scaled) the data and after leaving i t unnormal- ized (unscaled)., We found that the accuracies for predicting grade were similar whether the data were normalized or unnormalized2322 P.Patil et al., completely rank-based mode as PAM50 does the broader implica- tion of this result is that one may try to build predictors that operateonly on the ranks of data, thereby bypassing the need for any nor-malization step when predicting on a test set., Acknowledgements This study used data generated by METABRIC we thank the British Columbia Cancer Agency Branch for sharing these invaluable data with the scientific community., We acknowledge the great support from the InSilicoDB team for storage and programmatic access to our compendium of breast can-cer microarray datasets., Funding B.

Here is a detailed description of the methodology:\n\n1. **Study Population and Data Collection**: The authors curated gene expression microarray data from 28 independent studies, which included a total of 6,297 patients. These datasets spanned 15 different proprietary platform types and included data from various sources such as the Gene Expression Omnibus and ArrayExpress. The metadata for these studies were manually curated to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n2. **PAM Model Fitting**: The authors utilized the Prediction Analysis of Microarrays (PAM) method, a supervised learning approach, to build prediction models using the gene expression data. They employed the `pamr` R package to fit the PAM model, which involved calculating average gene expression profiles (centroids) for each class and applying a shrinkage threshold to retain only the most informative genes. The model was trained using 10-fold cross-validation to optimize predictive accuracy.\n\n3. **Normalization Procedure**: Normalization of gene expression data was performed using quantile rescaling, implemented in the `genefu` R package. This method involved scaling each gene expression value based on specific quantiles from the expression data, which was found to be robust against extreme outliers. The authors compared predictions made with and without normalization to assess the impact of normalization on classification outcomes.\n\n4. **Estimating Test Set Bias**: To estimate test set bias, the authors applied the PAM50 predictor to their curated datasets. They investigated how predictions for individual patients varied when the normalization was performed on different subsets of patients. This included analyzing the effects of varying the number of patients included in the normalization process and the distribution of key characteristics, such as estrogen receptor (ER) status, within the test set.\n\n5. **Rank-Based Predictions**: The authors proposed an alternative approach using rank-based predictions, which they hypothesized would be immune to test set bias. They calculated similarity based on Spearman correlation, which relies on the ranks of gene expression values rather than the raw values. This approach was tested against the traditional PAM50 method to evaluate its robustness across different platforms.\n\n6. **Cross-Platform Validation**: The methodology included cross-platform validation, where the trained PAM model was applied to datasets from different platforms (Affymetrix, Agilent, and Illumina).

This bias occurs when the predictions for a single patient depend on the data from other patients in the test set, leading to inconsistent classifications.\n\n2. **Impact of Normalization**: The authors demonstrate that the normalization methods used for gene expression data can lead to different predictions for the same patient based on the composition and size of the test set. This variability can result in a patient being classified into different clinical groups depending on the normalization context.\n\n3. **Rank-Based Gene Signatures**: As a solution to avoid test set bias, the paper proposes the use of rank-based gene signatures. By relying on the ranks of gene expression data rather than raw values, the authors show that predictions can remain stable across different patient populations and normalization scenarios.\n\n4. **PAM50 Signature Analysis**: The study specifically examines the PAM50 gene signature for breast cancer subtyping. It illustrates that predictions using the PAM50 signature can vary significantly when the test set composition changes, but can be made invariant to such changes when using a rank-based approach.\n\n5. **Clinical Implications**: The findings underscore the clinical importance of ensuring that genomic predictions are reliable and reproducible. Variability in patient classification due to test set bias could have significant implications for treatment decisions and patient outcomes.\n\n6. **Methodology and Data**: The research utilized a comprehensive dataset from 28 independent studies, encompassing various platforms and patient populations, to validate the findings regarding test set bias and the effectiveness of rank-based predictions.\n\nOverall, the paper emphasizes the need for careful consideration of normalization methods in genomic studies and advocates for the adoption of rank-based approaches to enhance the reproducibility of gene signatures in clinical applications."

      "question": "How was the data analyzed in the study?",
      "answer": "In the study, data analysis was conducted using several key methods:\n\n1. **Data Collection and Curation**: The researchers collected gene expression microarray data from 28 independent studies, which included a variety of platforms (Affymetrix, Illumina, Agilent, and custom arrays). The data were curated from multiple sources, including the Gene Expression Omnibus and ArrayExpress.\n\n2. **PAM Model Fitting**: The study employed the Prediction Analysis of Microarrays (PAM) method, which is a supervised learning approach. The pamr package in R was used to fit a PAM model. This involved calculating average gene expression profiles (centroids) for each class, shrinking these centroids to eliminate non-contributing genes, and using 10-fold cross-validation to determine the optimal shrinkage threshold for maximizing predictive accuracy.\n\n3. **Normalization Procedure**: The researchers applied quantile rescaling for normalization, using the genefu package. This method involved scaling gene expression values based on specific quantiles, which was found to be robust against extreme outliers.\n\n4. **Estimating Test Set Bias**: To estimate test set bias, the researchers applied the PAM50 predictor to their data. They created test sets through 10-fold cross-validation, training on 90% of the data and testing on the remaining 10%. Predictions were made both on the same platform and across different platforms to assess the impact of test set composition on predictions.\n\n5. **Comparison of Predictions**: The study compared predictions made using normalized data versus unnormalized data. They specifically looked at how the PAM50 signature's predictions varied based on the normalization method and the composition of the test set, particularly focusing on the estrogen receptor (ER) status of patients.\n\n6. **Statistical Analysis**: The analysis included calculating concordance between predictions made under different normalization conditions and assessing the predictive accuracy across various platforms and patient populations.\n\nOverall, the data analysis in the study was comprehensive, involving model fitting, normalization, bias estimation, and rigorous statistical comparisons to evaluate the reproducibility and reliability of gene signatures in clinical settings."

      "question": "Was the data in the study pre-processed in anyway? If so how?",
      "answer": "Yes, the data in the study was pre-processed through normalization. The normalization procedure involved quantile rescaling, which is implemented in the genefu package. This method scales each gene expression value using specific quantiles from the expression data. The researchers found that a quantile of q=0.05 was robust based on examinations of multiple microarray datasets. The normalization process defined the expression values corresponding to the desired quantiles and calculated scaled values accordingly. This approach is noted to be more robust to extreme outlying gene expression values compared to scaling by the maximum and minimum values.\n\nAdditionally, the study compared predictions made using normalized data versus unnormalized data. The PAM50 predictions were made using both approaches, and it was found that predictions remained consistent when using rank-based metrics without normalization, which helped avoid test set bias. Thus, the study highlights the importance of normalization in ensuring comparability of genomic data while also exploring alternatives that do not rely on normalization."

      "question": "How does the paper address potential biases in the research?",
      "answer": "The paper addresses potential biases in the research, specifically focusing on \"test set bias,\" which occurs when the predictions for a single patient depend on the data from other patients in the test set. The authors highlight that traditional normalization methods can introduce variability in patient classifications based on the composition and size of the test set, leading to irreproducibility of gene signatures. \n\nTo mitigate this bias, the authors propose using rank-based features instead of raw gene expression values. They argue that rank-based predictions are less susceptible to changes in the test set composition, as they rely on the relative ranking of gene expression rather than absolute values. This approach ensures that the classification of a patient remains consistent regardless of the other patients included in the normalization process.\n\nThe paper also emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the test set is representative of the training data to maintain the reliability of predictions. By demonstrating that predictions can vary significantly based on the normalization method and the characteristics of the test set, the authors advocate for the development of gene signatures that operate on ranks, thereby avoiding the need for normalization and reducing the risk of test set bias. \n\nIn summary, the paper addresses potential biases by identifying the issue of test set bias, proposing rank-based methods as a solution, and emphasizing the need for representative test sets to ensure reproducibility and reliability in genomic predictions."

      "question": "What validation methods were used to ensure the reliability of the results?",
      "answer": "The research paper employs several validation methods to ensure the reliability of the results regarding gene expression test set bias and the reproducibility of gene signatures. Here are the key validation methods used:\n\n1. **Cross-Validation**: The authors utilized 10-fold cross-validation to train their PAM (Prediction Analysis of Microarrays) model. This method involves dividing the dataset into ten subsets, using nine for training and one for testing, and repeating this process to ensure that every data point is used for both training and testing. This helps in assessing the model's predictive accuracy and robustness.\n\n2. **Comparison of Predictions Across Different Normalization Methods**: The study compared predictions made using both normalized and unnormalized data. By analyzing how predictions varied based on the normalization approach, the authors demonstrated the impact of test set bias and validated the effectiveness of rank-based predictions.\n\n3. **Use of Multiple Datasets**: The research included data from 28 independent studies, which spanned various platforms and patient populations. This diversity in data sources helps in validating the generalizability of the findings across different contexts and conditions.\n\n4. **Statistical Measures**: The authors calculated average prediction accuracies and standard deviations across the cross-validation folds, providing a quantitative measure of the model's performance and reliability.\n\n5. **Rank-Based Prediction Analysis**: The authors proposed using rank-based features instead of raw expression values, hypothesizing that this approach would be immune to test set bias. They validated this hypothesis by comparing the performance of rank-based predictions with traditional methods.\n\n6. **Reproducibility Checks**: The authors emphasized the importance of reproducibility by showing that predictions for the same patient could change based on the normalization method and the patient population used. They provided evidence that rank-based predictions remained consistent regardless of these factors.\n\nThese methods collectively contribute to the reliability and robustness of the study's findings regarding gene expression and the implications of test set bias in clinical predictions."

      "question": "Are there any contradictions between this paper's findings and previous research?",
      "answer": "Based on the content of the research paper, there are indeed contradictions between the findings of this paper and previous research. The paper highlights the issue of test set bias in genomic signatures, particularly in the context of breast cancer microarray experiments. It argues that existing gene signatures, which rely on normalizing test data, may yield irreproducible results when the composition or size of the patient population changes. This is a significant departure from previous research that may have assumed that normalization methods would consistently yield reliable predictions across different patient populations.\n\nFor example, the paper discusses the PAM50 signature, which is a well-established method for breast cancer subtyping. It points out that predictions for the same patient can vary significantly depending on how the test data is normalized, which contradicts the assumption that a genomic signature should provide consistent classifications for the same patient data. This finding challenges the reliability of genomic signatures that have been previously reported in the literature, which often did not account for the variability introduced by normalization methods.\n\nAdditionally, the paper proposes using rank-based features instead of raw expression values to avoid test set bias, suggesting that traditional normalization methods may not be as robust as previously thought. This contrasts with earlier studies that relied heavily on normalization techniques without considering their potential impact on reproducibility and classification consistency.\n\nIn summary, the paper's findings suggest that the reliance on normalization methods in previous research may have led to overestimation of the reliability of genomic signatures, highlighting a critical area of concern that was not adequately addressed in earlier studies."
