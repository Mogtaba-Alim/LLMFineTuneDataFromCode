Much of the difficulty in establishing reliable predictors lies in the genetic diversity of human cancers and so gene set association is a natural investigative avenue., Cell line drug response trials offer a vast array of quantifiable phenotypes and so GSEA can be utilized to find gene sets associated with a particular drug response10, 11., GSEA requires a pre-defined collection of gene sets as input then provides a score to each gene sets association with a phenotype., We refer to the distribution of these scores attributed to a particular collection by GSEA as thatOPEN SUBJECT AREAS, BIOINFORMATICS CANCER GENOMICS Received 25 September 2013 Accepted 29 January 2014 Published 13 February 2014 Correspondence and requests for materials should be addressed to B.H.-K.

We further observe that there is little overlap between the standard collections and that col- lection performance is predicted by gene count or shared phenotypic characteristics with the phenotype under study., Lastly we showed that a new collection based on co-expressed gene sets extracted from cancer cell lines experiments supplants C2 as the lead collection of gene sets when included in the analysis., Results To investigate the impact of a particular collection on GSEAs results we conducted gene set analyses for 138 drugs tested on 727 cell lines 8., The collections tested were the seven standard collections made available through the tools distributor, together these seven collec- tions are refered to as the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)., There exists no de facto consensus among the community as to which gene set collections are to be used within GSEA., Of the first 32 hits on a PubMed search for GSEA 9 articles did not specify the source of their gene sets, 7 articles noted a manual curation and omitted the methodology, 14 specified specific particular instances or subsets of the collections within MSigDB and only 1 article spe- cified that the entire MSigDB was used (supplementary file 1)., Justifications for the choices made were almost uniformly omitted. The seven collections are generated using different strategies and thus the number of unique genes accounted for within a collection varies., Table 3 shows the number of unique genes contained in each collection. We compared the number of gene sets in each of the MSigDB collections (Figure 1A, Table 1).

These indices range in value between 0.0106 and 0.0223 (mean 5 0.0167, sd 50.00352.) All scores are available in supplementary file 2. We observed that the highest degree of overlapping is observed between C2 a collection of gene sets curated from biological data- bases and biomedical literature (Table 1) and C4, a collection com-posed of gene sets created by mining three large microarray studies (Table 1) with gindex of 0.0223, doubling the maximal overlap score of C1., The C4 and the Gene Ontology set C5 share the next highestoverlapping index ( gindex of 0.0212). C1 based on gene position in cytogenetic bands, shows very little overlap with all sets (maximum g index of 0.0118 with the C2 set.), C1 is the only collection based ongene proximity while all other collections attempt to group genes based on phenotypes, pathways or within the classification proposed by Gene Ontology 22., We refer to the distribution of enrichment scores attributed to a collection by GSEA as that collections enrichment profile., For each drug we performed a gene set enrichment analysis with each indi-vidual collection to produce 138 enrichment profiles for each collec- tion., Under the assumption that highly enriched gene sets are more indicative of a collections value than the overall distribution of itssets, we compared the distributions of normalized enrichment scores with absolute values greater than 2 for each collection (Figure 2A)., Within the overall density graph we observed an approximately nor-mal distribution with a mean absolute normalized enrichment score (NES) of around 1.0 for all collections., At the high end of the density curves we note that the C4 collection contains the highest scoringgene sets overall, followed by C2 and C6 (Figure 2A)., We also counted the number of enriched gene sets for each drug within each collection (Figure 2B). Overall GSEA identified significantly moreenriched gene sets in the C2 and C4 collections (Table 2)., In order to understand the relative effectiveness of each collection in providing highly enriched gene sets in the given context we plottedthe fractional contribution of the top scoring sets for the aggregationof all drugs., Each drug was polled for its top scoring gene set (highest absolute NES) and the sets collection of origin was identified., The ratio of sets contributed by a collection to the total of these top scoring sets is that collections fractional contribution., The number of gene sets polled per drug was incremented from one to fifty and the results are plotted in Figure 3., This procedure permits a competitive analysis of the gene set collections. We observed that the C2 collec- tion is the dominant collection followed by C4 and the remaining collections do remarkably less well with little distinction among them., We introduced a new data-driven collection to the competitive analysis in order to compare the leading MSigDB collections to an external collection., We also sought to test whether the standard collections offered the highest scoring gene sets for the phenotype under study., This collection was built by computing sets of tightly co- expressed genes in cancer cell lines produced by GlaxoSmithKline and published by Greshock et al., 20. We performed a hierarchical clustering analysis to compute the nested structure of co-expression gene sets (Figure 4, see Methods)., We repeated the competitive ana- lysis described previously with this new collection of co-expressed gene sets, referred to as HGSK (short for hierarchicalGlaxoSmithKline.), As can be seen in Figure 3B the HGSK collection dominates the remainder of the collections mostly at the expense of the C2 collection., However when a greater number of enriched gene sets are considered (n .30), C2 contributed more and more gene sets and approached HGSKs contribution., The C4 collections con- tribution remains largely unaffected by the inclusion of HGSK. The contributions of other collections remain negligible. Discussion Despite the widespread use of gene set enrichment analyses in bio-medical research the choice of the gene set collection is rarely dis- cussed and its impact on the overall analysis results remains an open question., Here we examine the varied expression profiles yielded by the standard collections when performing gene set enrichment ana- lyses within the specific context of drug response in cancer cell lines.We do this by contrasting the performance of the seven standard collections curated by the Broad Institute., Among these standard collections there is a remarkable variance in the number and strength of association shown in the results., Notably C2 and C4 aggregate significantly more gene sets associated with the phenotypes under Figure 1 |(A) Number and identity of gene sets identified as highly enriched (absolute normalized enrichment score .2.0, maximum FDR , 25% across all drugs)., (B) Heatmap of gene collection overlap score (g-index).www.nature.com/ scientificreports SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 4 , 4092 | DOI,  10.1038/srep04092 3 study., This is in part unsurprising as collections built around cancer studies may enjoy a positive bias as to gene set association to pheno-type given that the phenotypes under study is drug response incancer cell lines., However a collection creation strategy based oncancer studies is clearly not a predictor of performance on our met-rics as is demonstrated by the poor performance of the oncogenicsignature collection C6.To further explore the impact of gene set collection on the GSEA results, we built our own collection,  referred to as HGSK, based onhierarchical clustering analysis of co-expressed genes in an inde-pendent dataset of cancer cell lines., We then compared the resultsoffered by this collection to simulate an unfiltered data-drivenapproach to the study of drug response in cancer cell lines.Unsurprisingly, the HGSK collection outperforms the leader among Figure 2 |(A) Density plot representing the distribution of normalized enrichement scores for all drugs in each collection individually., (B) Heatmap of the number of highly enriched gene sets (absolute normalized enrichement score .2.0 FDR , 25%) for each drug,  in each collection., Gene set collections are listed along the bottom of the figure and drugs along the right.

Figure 3 |(A) Fractional contribution of each collection to the set of top scoring gene sets with ngene sets per drug., nis plotted along the abscise. The ordinance shows the fraction of top gene sets contributed by each collection to the set of top scoring gene sets., As nincreases, a higher number of gene sets per drug are assumed to be relevant or significant. Collection C2 is the highest contributor by a large margin followed by C4, all other collections contribute to a negligible degree., The fractional contribution of C4 peaks before 10 top gene sets per drug, coinciding with C2s low. There is a slight trend downward in C4s contribution afterwards and a lesser trend upwards in the case of C2., (B) Fractional contribution of all Broads collections plus our data-driven gene set collection referred to as HGSK.www.nature.com/ scientificreports SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 4 ,  4092 | DOI, 10.1038/srep04092 4 the standard collections., Interestingly during the competitive ana- lysis HGSK gains come at the expense of C2 (curated primarily from pathway databases) and not C4 (which shares an oncological pedi- gree with HGSK.), This suggests that the signal provided by theunsupervised clustering algorithm tended towards the identificationof genes co-expressed in pathways and not communalities betweencancer cultures., However despite its better performance enrichedHGSK gene sets do not lend themselves to immediate biological interpretation, as they are not labeled using prior knowledge., Nonetheless this might be alleviated to a certain degree with thirdparty annotation tools such as the Gene Ontology, which could beused to annotate most HGSK gene sets although not all of them., A set of results that illustrates the interpretation and association tradeoff particularly well is found within the EGFR/ERBB2-target-ting drugs, Erlotinib,  Gefitinib,  Lapatinib and BIBW2992., The HGSKco-expression based gene set HGSK-547 is attributed a NES over 2.0in three of these four drugs., STRING-DB 23(Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins Database) finds the gene set to be significantly enriched in protein-protein interactions (p , 1E-16) and to be enriched in the KEGG pathway Tight Junction (p-value54E-5)., However little else is known about this set a priori with the exception of the co-expression of its members., On the other hand the standard collections often provide sets that reference lit- erature relevant to the nature and origin of the gene collection., A C2set JAEGER_METASTASIS_DN is another highly enriched gene setfor EGFR targeting drugs its title is suggestive of biological implica-tions and their source., This second set consists of genes found to be down-regulated in metastases of melanoma in a study geared towardsidentifying differential expression signatures between primary melano- mas and melanoma metastases 24., Note that in this case the gene set is not associated by protein or pathway interactions instead they arerevealed by a former study., A second interesting note here is that inthis case the C2 set JAEGER_META STASIS_DN held a higher aggreg- ate score among a family of drugs (EGFR) than the synthetic HGSK setwhereas the co-expression based co llection usually provides between 60% to 40% of top scoring gene sets as can be seen from Figure 2., Results from C2 and HGSK collections concur that chemosensi- tivity to EGFR/ERBB2 inhibitors is associated with the upregulationof cellular tight junction proteins among including the Claudinfamily of genes (Claudin-3, 4, 7)., These proteins assist in maintainingcell polarity and in the recruitment of other signaling proteins andtherefore were hypothesized to be involved in tumoregenesis 25., Recent work has shown that Claudin-7 inhibits cell migration ofhuman non-small cell lung cancer cells NCI-H1299 via an ERK/MAPK dependent process 26., According to Lu and co-workers the overexpression of Claudin-7 diminished the phosphorylation ofERK1/2 and hence inhibited the aggressiveness of lung cancerthrough a MAPK/ERK dependent pathway., EGFR is an upstreamactivator of this pathway and thus it may be that the upregulation ofthese tight junction protein genes may attenuate cancer invasivenessin the presence of EGFR inhibitors 26., Our results suggest that this family of proteins would be an interesting target of further researchto elucidate their potential as prognostic biomarkers for patient res-ponse to EGFR inhibitors., A recent study showed that Claudin-7sensitizes lung cancer cells to Cisplatin treatment through a caspasedependent pathway 27., In the CGP study, Garnett et al. identified ERBB2 expression as an indicator of Lapatinib response8. This is supported by the presence of the ERBB2 gene symbol in the top scoring gene set for Lapatinibsensitivity, COLDREN_GEFITINIB_RESISTANCE_DN., This geneset is constructed based on microarray gene expression profiling ofGefitinib testing on non-small cell lung cancer cell lines 28., The results of the GSEA analyses for the MEK1/2 inhibitors were investigated. Selumetinib and PD0325901 are investigational drugs that inhibit the MEK 1 and 2 dual-specificity kinases that upregulate the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway in MEK-overexpressing tumors.Pathways associated with sensitivity to MEK inhibitors were found tobe enriched in genes involved in the innate immune response., Forexample a pattern of genes from the Toll-like receptors pathway(TLR2,  TLR8,  CD86, CD14) is known to activate immune cell res-ponses., Recently a work by Peroval et al 2013 emphasized the com-plex role of MAPK signaling pathways in the transcriptionalregulation of Toll-like receptors 29., It is possible that these receptors would trigger cell death when MEK kinases are degraded. Thus while GSEA offers interesting results and is valuable in the generation of hypotheses for further investigation, the utility of thestandard collections,  in the context of drug response in cancer celllines, varies., In this context, C2 contributes 2 high scoring sets foreach submitted by C4. Of further interest is the particularly poorperformance of the C5 set which is based on the Gene Ontologiescollection and the C6 collection based on oncogenic signatures., TheC6 collection was expected to do well given the nature of the cell lines.Both of these fare far worse than a collection based on data miningimmunology research., As expected, the HGSK co-expression basedgene set collections scores high. This further demonstrates the sens-itivity of the GSEA process to the collection used in the analyses., TheHGSK collection also highlights the value offered by the annotationof the standard curated collections., It is important to note thatHGSK itself is built from a dataset that closely resembles the datasetbeing probed., This is done to model a data-driven approach to geneset collection creation no claims are made about it being a usefulcollection outside of this context., Our intent here is to show thevariation in the results among the collections currently being usedby the community., Furthermore only the MSigDB gene set collec- Figure 4 |Creation of the HGSK set collection is done by creating a gene- gene distance measure based on the reciprocal of a gene-gene correlation matrix from the expression of tumour cell lines in the GSK data set., Genes are clustered using traditional hierarchical clustering based on the distance measure. Depth first recursive tree generation is done, iterating over the prior sub-trees of cluster. Sets containing less than 15 genes or more than 500 are discarded.www.nature.com/ scientificreports SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 4 , 4092 | DOI, 10.1038/srep04092 5 tions are reviewed and solely in the context of drug response in tumour cell lines., In addition despite its popularity, the gene set analysis method as proposed faces some criticism30., In conclusion gene-set association with cancer drug response done by GSEA are sensitive to the gene-set collection used and two gene set collections consistently offer results of a higher significance in the context of drug response in cancer cell lines., Research lever- aging GSEA should closely evaluate gene set collection selection criteria. Studies published using the tool should precisely report the nature of the collection used in the analyses., Methods The overall analysis design is represented in Figure 5 and the details of each step are described here., Gene set analysis .The gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) technique developed by Subramanian and colleagues14is a widely used method of measuring the association between a set of genes and a phenotype in gene expression profiling data sets., GSEA enables detection of gene sets enriched in genes that are significantly associated with a phenotype of interest., Such enrichment is computed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov(KS) statistic 15. This statistic compares the anticipated random distribution of a sets genes and their actual distribution among a genome-wide list of genes ranked based on their association with the phenotype., The KS statistic is then normalized for gene set size and its significance is adjusted to take into account multiple hypothesestesting., A Java implementation of this method16is made publicly available by the authors. GSEA requires an a priori gene set collection to be defined. Therefore alongside the tool,  the Broad Institute makes available several gene set collections, referred to as MSigDB 17,  which is described in the next section., Gene set collections .Seven collections of gene sets are made available for use with GSEA by the Broad Institute., (http//www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp)These collections,  all together, are referred to as MSigDB 17., We downloaded the latest version (4.0) of the collections from the above URL. Table 1 gives a brief description of each collection summarizing the information available from the website., Overlap between gene set collections .In order to measure the overlap between collections of gene sets each pair of collections was subjected to a pairwise comparison of gene sets based on the h-index18and the Jaccard index19in which the ratio of the cardinality of the intersection of the sets to the cardinality of the union of the sets is calculated., This index referred to as g9,  is calculated using the following formula, g0~Ci\\Cj/C12/C12/C12/C12/C14 Ci|Cj/C12/C12/C12/C12 For collections CandDthat provide sets C1through CmandD1through Dn respectively, g(C, D) is the largest proportion of the n3mpairings where g9is greater to or equal to g. We referred to this metric as the gene set overlap index or the g-score., Co-expression gene set collection based on cancer cell line data .In addition to the Broads collections of gene sets, we created a new collection based on a fully data- driven analysis of cancer cell lines., This collection of sets was built using gene co- expression data from an independent dataset of 311 cancer cell lines, referred to as the Figure 5 |Overall analysis design used in our comparative study., First we calculated the overlap between each pair of gene set collections. Second we used a large pharmacogenomic dataset (CGP) to rank all the genes with respect to their association to response to each of the 138 drugs., Third we used these rankings together with the gene set collections to run multiple GSEA. Fourth the results are aggregated to compare the most enriched gene se ts across collections. The results are then interpreted by taking into account the overlap between collections.www.nature.com/ scientificreports SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 4 , 4092 | DOI,  10.1038/srep04092 6 GSK dataset in the literature20., A gene-expression correlation matrix was calculated and a distance matrix was taken as 1 minus the correlation matrix., We then used the resulting distance matrix to generate a hierarchical clustering21of the cancer cell lines genes., The clustering was recursively partitioned into all possible sets that respected the hierarchy and were composed of at least 15 and no more than 500 genes in size., Figure 4 summarizes the creation of the HGSK collection. Theresulting co-expression gene sets are provided in Supplementary File 4. Gene ranking based on association with drug response .To compute a genome-wide ranking of genes based on their associations with drug sensitivity, we used the area under the dose response curve (AUC) as a measure of drug sensitivity 8and we assessed the association between gene expression and drug response using a linear regression model controlled for tissue type., For each gene iwe fit two linear models M0and M 1,  M0, Y~b0zbtT M1, Y~b0 0zb0 iGizb0 tT where Ydenotes the drug sensitivity variable (AUC), GandTdenote the expression of gene iand the tissue type respectively and bsare the regression coefficients, i.e.,  b90is the intercept, b9tis the regression coefficient for the categorical variable Trepresenting the tissue type and b9i, regression coefficient for the continuous variable G representing the expression of the gene of interest., The strength of gene-drugassociation is quantified by b9 i above and beyond the relationship between drug sensitivity and tissue type., The variables Y and G are scaled (standard deviation equals to 1) in order to get standardized coefficients from the linear model., Significance of the gene-drug association is estimated by computing the F statistic using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) comparing the two nested models, M 0and M 1., All genes are then ranked with respect to their F statistic that is the significance of the association between their expression and drug sensitivity, and the direction of the correspondingassociation (negative if expression of gene iis association with drug resistance, positive otherwise)., Gene set enrichment analysis .To assess the association of a collection of gene sets with sensitivity to each of the 138 drugs screened in CGP, we used version 2.0.13 of the GSEA tool developed by the Broad Institute., Pre-ranked GSEA requires two input files a gene set collection (the Broads collections for instance) and a genome-wide ranking of genes, as described previously., We ran pre-ranked GSEA on each gene setcollection to compute enrichment scores for each gene set within the collections., The magnitude of normalized enrichment scores and FDR values were used to evaluate the effectiveness of each collection in identifying candidate gene sets that influence drug response in cancer cell lines., 1.

Here is a detailed description of the methodology:\n\n1. **Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)**: The authors utilized the GSEA technique, which assesses the association between predefined gene sets and phenotypes based on gene expression data. GSEA employs the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic to compare the distribution of genes in a gene set against a ranked list of all genes based on their association with a specific phenotype.\n\n2. **Gene Set Collections**: The study compared seven standard gene set collections provided by the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). These collections include:\n   - C1: Positional gene sets\n   - C2: Curated gene sets from various sources\n   - C3: Motif gene sets\n   - C4: Computational gene sets from cancer-related microarray data\n   - C5: Gene Ontology gene sets\n   - C6: Oncogenic signatures\n   - C7: Immunologic signatures\n\n3. **Creation of a New Gene Set Collection**: In addition to the standard collections, the authors developed a new collection (HGSK) based on gene co-expression data from cancer cell lines. This involved:\n   - Calculating a gene-expression correlation matrix from a dataset of 311 cancer cell lines.\n   - Generating a distance matrix and performing hierarchical clustering to identify co-expressed gene sets, which were then filtered to include sets with 15 to 500 genes.\n\n4. **Drug Response Dataset**: The authors analyzed a large pharmacogenomic dataset (Cancer Genome Project dataset) that includes drug response data for 138 drugs tested on 727 unique cancer cell lines. The area under the dose-response curve (AUC) was used as a measure of drug sensitivity.\n\n5. **Gene Ranking**: The authors ranked genes based on their association with drug sensitivity using linear regression models. They fit two models to assess the significance of gene expression in relation to drug response, controlling for tissue type.\n\n6. **Multiple GSEA Runs**: The GSEA was performed for each gene set collection against the ranked gene lists derived from the drug response data. This produced multiple enrichment profiles for each collection.\n\n7. **Comparison of Enrichment Profiles**: The authors compared the enrichment scores and the number of significantly enriched gene sets across the different collections. They assessed the effectiveness of each collection in identifying candidate gene sets associated with drug response.\n\n8. **Statistical Analysis**: The authors employed statistical tests, including the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, to evaluate the differences in enrichment scores between collections. They also calculated overlap indices (g-index) to measure the similarity between gene set collections.\n\n9. **Visualization**: The results were visualized using density plots and heatmaps to illustrate the distribution of normalized enrichment scores and the number of enriched gene sets for each drug within each collection.\n\nIn summary, the methodology combines GSEA with a comparative analysis of multiple gene set collections, including the development of a new collection based on co-expression data, to evaluate their impact on identifying gene sets associated with drug response in cancer cell lines."
