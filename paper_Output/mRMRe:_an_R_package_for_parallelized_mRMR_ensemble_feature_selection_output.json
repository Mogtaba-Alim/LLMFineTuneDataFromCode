Because feature selection is an nondeterministic poly-nomial time (NP)-hard problem one must resort to the use of heuristics, which find suitable and sub-optimal sets of relevant features in high-dimensional datasets., Among these heuristics the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) feature selection technique is particularly appealing because of the rela- tively low computational complexity of its algorithm for finding aset of relevant and complementary features (Ding and Peng, 2005),  from which accurate predictive models are developed.The challenge lies in that mRMR, like all feature selection algo-rithms in a low sample-to-dimensionality ratio setting, produces highly variable results, and small changes in sample data often lead to dramatically different sets of selected features., In the past decade a new trend has emerged whereby highly accurate ensemble classifiers are produced by combining lessaccurate ones, on the grounds that model variance is reduced without affecting bias (Kittler et al.,  1998)., However the com- putational cost of an ensemble variant of the mRMR method ishigh, as multiple mRMR feature selections must be done., Thiswas the primary motivator for the development of a new Rpackage mRMRe, which implements an ensemble variant ofmRMR,  in which multiple feature sets, rather than a single listof features,  is built., Also included in the package is a function for computing a mutual information matrix (MIM) based on the appropriate estimators for each variable type (i.e., continuous,discrete and survival data). Both these package features havebeen adapted to fully use multicore platforms. 2 METHODS Themim function computes a MIM using a linear approximation based on correlation such that mutual information (MI) is estimated as Ix, y14/C01 2ln1/C0/C26x, y2,  where Iand /C26,  respectively, represent the MI and correlation coefficient between variables xandy., Correlation between continuous variables can be computed using either Pearsons or Spearmans estimators, whereas Cramers V is used for correlation between discrete variables and Somers Dxy index is used for correlation between continuous variables and survival data., The mRMR technique as implemented in the mRMR.classic func- tion, allows an efficient selection of relevant and non-redundant fea- tures (Ding and Peng,  2005)., Let ybe the output variable and X14fx1,...,xngbe the set of ninput features. The method ranks X by maximizing the MI with y(maximum relevance) and minimizing the average MI with all the previously selected variables (minimum redundancy)., Let xibe the feature with highest MI with the output variable and thus selected first xi14arg max xi2XIxi, y 1*To whom correspondence should be addressed., yThe authors wish it to be known that in their opinion, the first two authors should be regarded as joint First Authors., /C223The Author 2013.

Similar to Papillon-Cavanagh et al. (2013) we used CGP as a training set,  whereas CCLE was split in two validation sets, CCLE COMMON contains cell lines common to both CGP and CCLE (471), whereas CCLE NEW contains cell lines absent in CGP (565)., We then implemented five feature selection methods (i) SINGLEGENE and (ii) RANK consist in ranking the features by correlation with drug sensitivity so as to, respectively,  select the first and the top nfeatures, (iii) mRMR is used to select the most relevant, less redundant set of nfeatures associated to drug sensitivity, (iv) mRMRe.e and (v) mRMRe.b perform multiple mRMR feature selections in parallel to identify 200 mRMRsolutions using the exhaustive and bootstrap approach, respect- ively., Feature selection was followed by linear regression model fitting using the selected features to predict drug sensitivity., FormRMRe methods drug sensitivity is predicted by averaging pre- dictions of the 200 multivariate models corresponding to each mRMR solution., To strike a balance between model complexity considered here as the number of selected features (solution length),  and prediction performance, we performed 100 resamplings of thetraining set and estimated the concordance index (Harrell et al., 1996) of the resulting predictive model with respect to feature selection method and solution length (Fig., 1A). As theconcordance index is a generalization of the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, high-performing models are associated with index values close to 1, and random modelsare expected to yield index values close to 0.5., We observed that mRMRe methods yielded higher performance (Wilcoxon signed rank test P50001, see Supplementary Table S1),  especially for small ( /C205) solution lengths., As expected the gain in perform- ance rapidly diminished with increasing solution length (Supplementary Fig., S1). We consequently selected 15 as thesolution length exhibiting the most balance between model com- plexity and performance (Fig., 1B). In addition, we computed the variance of the concordance index over multiple resamplings(Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S2) and observed that the clas- sical and ensemble mRMR variants produced lower variance when compared with RANK or SINGLEGENE., Variance wasmuch lower for ensemble mRMR techniques when compared with classical mRMR techniques for small ( /C205) solution lengths., However, no difference was observed for larger solution lengths(Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition to performance assessment diversity (Tsymbal et al . 2005) and stability (Guzma  n-Mart  nez and Alaiz- Rodr  guez,  2011,  Kuncheva, 2007) of the mRMRe, feature selection techniques implemented were investigated (Supplementary Fig., S3). Although RANK and mRMR select30 different genes during each resampling of the training set the mRMRe techniques identify multiple,  possibly diverse,  mRMR solutions in parallel., In fact we observed that,  on average, mRMRe.e selects 210 distinct features shared between the 200 distinct mRMR solutions (Supplementary Fig., S3A), whereasTable 1. Run-time performances in seconds of mRMRe and sideChannelAttack packages using the CGP dataset Package Full MIM mRMR mRMRe.e mRMRe.b mRMRe 80 23 36 863 sideChannelAttack 158 212 NA NA Note , Benchmarks were performed on a Dell PowerEdge R815 using 8 CPU cores (out of 48, from 4 /C212-core,  2.2 GHz AMD Opteron) and 12 GB of RAM., 2366N.De Jay et al.Downloaded from https //academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/29/18/2365/239921 by University Health Network - Health Sciences Library user on 20 November 2023 mRMRe.b is much more diverse with an average of 988 distinct features (Supplementary Fig., S3B). The greater diversity of mRMRe.b can partly explain the better performance observedin the training set (Tsymbal et al., 2005)., To assess the stability of the five feature selection methods the Tanimoto Stability Index was implemented as described in (Guzma  n-Mart  nez and Alaiz-Rodr  guez, 2011)., This index enables the comparison of the sets of selected features with each resampling of the trainingset., As can be seen in Supplementary Figure S3C selecting the gene that correlates most with Irinotecan sensitivity yielded the most stable results (Supplementary File S2)., Concurring withGarnett et al . (2012), we found the most frequently selected gene to be FLI1. However the association between FLI1 expres- sion and Irinotecan sensitivity remains poorly understood., Ensemble mRMR feature selections produce more stable gene lists when compared with classical mRMR. Stability of the genelists obtained with mRMRe.e is close to that of SINGLEGENE whereas mRMRe.bs exhibited stability is virtually identical to that of RANK for solution lengths 47., To validate the performance of the mRMRe feature selection approach independent validation sets were tested, and it was observed that mRMRe yielded a higher concordance index over-all (Fig., 1C and D). When predicting response to Irinotecan for the same cell lines (CCLE COMMON) mRMR.e and mRMR.bapproaches outperformed classical mRMR with an improvement of 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively (Fig., 1C). For new cell lines(CCLE NEW) the gain was more notable with mRMRe.e and mRMRe.b, yielding an improvement of 2.1% and 3.4%,  respect- ively (Fig., 1D). This supports the superior generalization abilityof the ensemble mRMR approaches especially mRMRe.b be- cause it identifies a more diverse panel of mRMR solutions (Supplementary Fig., S4). We further investigated the advantage of using mRMRe for biological interpretation by performing a Gene Ontology analysis using the GOSim package., Because ensemble mRMR techniques by their very nature,  select more genes than the other techniques, we expect more biological terms to be significantlyenriched with the former., This is indeed the case as illustrated in Supplementary Figure S5,  100,  21, 167 and 400 Gene Ontology terms have been identified as significantly enriched (Fishersexact test P50, 05) for RANK,  mRMR,  mRMRe.e and mRMRe.b,  respectively (Supplementary File 3)., Finally we compared the run-time performance of our func- tions with those of the sideChannelAttack package (Lerman et al ., 2011),  the latter implements the classical mRMR and relies on the minet package (Meyer et al., 2008) to build the MIM., As reported in Table 1 our package,  on a 8-core work- station, is twice as fast for full MIM construction and 9.2 timesfaster for classical mRMR feature selection, this is mainly be- cause of the lazy MIM implementation., It is worth noting that the search for 200 mRMR solutions using mRMRe.e is still 5.9times faster than the classical mRMR with sideChannelAttack ., Moreover performing ensemble mRMR feature selection using the bootstrap method is as computationally demanding, as a new (lazy) MIM must be computed for each bootstrap., 4C O N C L U S I O N The R package mRMRe provides functions to efficiently per- form ensemble mRMR feature selection by taking full advantageof parallel computing., Ensemble mRMR can be beneficial from both a predictive (lower bias and lower variance) and biological (more thorough feature space exploration) point of view, whichmakes it particularly attractive for high-throughput genomic data analysis., Funding : B.H.Ks start-up funds (to N.D.J. and S.P.C.).

The authors compared the performance of the mRMRe methods against classical feature selection methods (SINGLEGENE and RANK) and assessed prediction accuracy using linear regression models fitted with the selected features.\n\n6. **Performance Evaluation**: The authors evaluated the performance of the feature selection methods using the concordance index, which measures the predictive accuracy of the models. They also assessed the stability and diversity of the selected features across multiple resamplings.\n\n7. **Biological Interpretation**: The mRMRe methods were further analyzed for their ability to provide biological insights, including Gene Ontology analysis to identify enriched biological terms associated with the selected features.\n\nOverall, the methodology emphasizes the development of a computationally efficient and robust feature selection tool that leverages ensemble techniques to improve predictive modeling in genomic data analysis."

      "question": "Can you provide a summary of the literature review from the paper?",
      "answer": "The literature review in the paper discusses the challenges associated with feature selection in high-throughput genomic data analysis, particularly focusing on the Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) technique. It highlights the importance of selecting relevant and complementary features to understand biological processes and build accurate predictive models. The authors note that feature selection is a complex task due to the high dimensionality and noise present in genomic datasets, which often leads to variable results from mRMR due to its sensitivity to small changes in sample data.\n\nThe review references previous work, particularly by Ding and Peng (2005), which established mRMR as a computationally efficient method for feature selection. It also discusses the emergence of ensemble methods in the past decade, which combine multiple classifiers to reduce model variance without increasing bias, as noted by Kittler et al. (1998).

      "question": "Are there any contradictions between this paper's findings and previous research?",
      "answer": "Based on the content of the research paper, there are no explicit contradictions mentioned between the findings of this paper and previous research. However, the paper does build upon and extend previous work, particularly the mRMR feature selection technique developed by Ding and Peng (2005). \n\nThe authors claim that their ensemble mRMR implementations outperform the classical mRMR approach in terms of prediction accuracy and stability, which suggests an improvement rather than a contradiction. They also highlight that ensemble methods can reduce variance and improve biological interpretations, which aligns with the trend of using ensemble classifiers to enhance predictive performance as noted in previous studies (e.g., Kittler et al., 1998).\n\nFurthermore, the paper references previous research (e.g., Garnett et al., 2012) to validate their findings, indicating that their results are consistent with existing literature regarding the identification of relevant genes associated with drug sensitivity. \n\nIn summary, while the paper presents advancements and improvements over previous methodologies, it does not indicate any direct contradictions with prior research findings."
