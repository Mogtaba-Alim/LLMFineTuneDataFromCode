We next developed a de novo GE signature (PredictIO) from our pan-cancer analysis and demonstrat ed its superior predictive value over other biomarkers., To identify novel targets we computed the T-cell dysf unction score for each gene within PredictIO and their ability to predict dual PD-1/CTLA -4 blockade in mice., Two genes F2RL1 (encoding protease-activated receptor-2) and RBFOX2 (encoding RNA-binding motif protein 9), were concurrently associated with worse ICB clinical outcomes, T-cell dysfunction in ICB-naive patients and resi stance to dual PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade in preclinical models., Conclusion Our study highlights the potential of large-scale meta-analyses in identifying novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for cancer immunotherapy.Key words, immunotherapy,  transcriptomic,  biomarker,  meta-analysis,  machine learning, scienti fic software INTRODUCTION Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with monoclonal anti- bodies (mAbs) targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) produces durable survivalbene fits in a variety of cancers., However, 60%-80% of treated patients do not derive any clinical bene fit. 1Resis- tance to ICB may be attributed to tumor-intrinsic factorssuch as genomic alterations oncogenic signaling and sup-pressed antigen presentation, 2-4or tumor-extrinsic factors*Correspondence to,  Prof. John Stagg,  CRCHUM,  900 St-Denis Street, Mon- treal,  H2X 0A2,  Canada., Tel: 1-1514-890-8000; ext 25170 E-mail: john.stagg@umontreal.ca (J.

Clinical outcome data includedresponse (according to RECIST or other response criteria) progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS)., Studies with fewer than 20 patients were excluded. Trials of ICB in combination with other treatment modalities such aschemotherapy targeted therapies and radiation wereexcluded., There was no minimum duration of follow-up forinclusion. Trials in the neoadjuvant setting were excluded(Supplementary Table S1  available at https, //doi.org/10., 1016/j.annonc.2022.08.084 ). Genomic signatures selected for evaluation were taken from papers showing association with immunotherapy response or known immune escape mechanism ( Supplementary Table S2 , available at https, // doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2022.08.084 )., Response to ICB treatment Response (R) was de fined as RECIST (v1.1) complete or partial response or stable disease (SD) without PFS event at 6 months., Non-response (NR) was de fined as RECIST pro- gressive disease or RECIST SD with a PFS event occurringwithin 6 months., If RECIST information was not available patients without any PFS event at 6 months and patientswith a PFS event occurring within 6 months were classi fied as R and NR, respectively., If PFS information was unavai-lable patients with RECIST SD as best response were clas-sified as not assessable., Data processing Outcome data and mutational and transcriptomic pro files were collected for each study., If not publicly available in-dividual patient clinical and molecular data information wasrequested from the corresponding authors., Somatic muta-tion data were composed of gene-level alteration with mutation context information (i.e., synonymous or non- synonymous). The processed transcriptomic pro file was composed of log2-transformed transcripts per million (TPM) data., Whenraw sequencing data were available (Fumet.1 26Fumet.2, 26 Hugo, 27Hwang, 28Jung29and Riaz30), transcript abundance was quanti fied from the fastq files through Salmon (v1.4.0), 31using the grch38 GENCODE transcriptome of reference., Gene-level TPM data were then obtained from the estimated transcript abundance level with tximport(v.1.20.0) R package., Otherwise raw count/TPM data weredownloaded directly from the respective publications(Braun, 32Jerby_Arnon, 20Liu, 33Mariathasan, 19Miao.1, 14 Snyder, 34Van_Allen13)., Fragments per kilobase of tran- script per million mapped reads (FPKM) from Nathansonet al. 35were converted to TPM data using the followingY. Bareche et al. Annals of Oncology Volume 33 -Issue 12 -2022 https //doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2022.08.084 1305 formula,  TPM i14/C18 FPKM iP jFPKM j/C19 /C2106., For each dataset, genes with zero expression value in at least 50% of the samples were filtered out. Because of the presence of variability in clinical follow-up between studies OS and PFS were censored,  respectively,  at 36 and 24 months., The data composition of the overall cohort is presented in Supplementary Table S1 available at https, // doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2022.08.084 ., After processing each study independently all the data- sets were gathered together into an ExpressionSet R ob- ject., For each molecular data type patients were thencompared to each other in order to remove any potentialsample coming from duplicated patients within each study and between studies., For the mutational pro files Cohen s k score /C210.9 was used to de fine samples coming from the same patient., For the transcriptomic pro file Spearman correlation /C210.98 was used to de fine samples coming from the same patient., Samples were removed from the study ifthey were de fined as duplicated for at least one of the two molecular data types., As a result 90 patients were removedfor Miao.2,  3612 patients from Braun, 321 from Jung29and 1 from Samstein.9 Tumor mutational burden computation As mutation pro files from the curated studies were het- erogeneous, with some studies reporting all the mutationsfound within each sample and others only reporting onlynon-synonymous mutation, we evaluated non-synonymousTMB across studies., The computation of the TMB per Mbwas carried out as de fined TMB14mut ns/target , w i t h mut ns and target defined,  respectively, as the number of non- synonymous mutations and the target size of thesequencing., For each tumor type within the meta-datasetTMB per Mb was calculated, and the median was used asa custom cut-point to assess low and high TMB(Supplementary Table S2 , available at https, //doi.org/10., 1016/j.annonc.2022.08.084 ). Gene signature computation Gene signatures ( Supplementary Tables S3-S7  available at https, //doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2022.08.084 ) composed of genes without any weight were computed using gene setvariation analysis (GSVA) 37enrichment score., Gene signa- tures composed of genes associated with speci fic weights (1 for increased and /C01 for decreased expression) were computed using the weighted mean expression as de fined, Gene_sig 14(SGene x/C2weight x)/#Gene,  with Gene x, weight x and#Gene corresponding, respectively, to the expression and the weight of the gene X and the total number of genes in the signature., For each investigated study signatures wereonly computed if at least 80% of their genes were present inthe data., We applied z-score transformation to the genes ofeach signature before the computation. The COX_ISImmunoPhenScore, Innate anti-PD-1 Resistance (IPRES) andTIDE signature scores were computed as described in theiroriginal publication., 1822, 27, 38Z-score transformation wasapplied before the GSVA or the weighted mean computa- tion and after the computation for the four speci fic signatures., Gene signature network analysis In order to assess the level of similarity between the curated signatures, we computed the matrix of overlappinggenes de fining each signature., Distance between signatures was then assessed using principal component analysis(PCA). Clusters of signatures were then derived by applyingthe PC1 and PC2 into Af finity Propagation Clustering (APC) using the apcluster (v1.4.8) R package., Within each clusterof at least two signatures we combined all the genes and computed the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis using the enrichR (v.3.0) Rpackage., 39 Gene signature correlation analysis Spearman correlation between each curated signature was computed within each ICB study from the discovery cohort.The median of each association was then plotted using thecorrplot (v.0.84) R package., De novo signature characterization We selected the 12 246 genes available in at least 12 of the 14 studies with transcriptomic data and carried out a meta-analysis of the association of these genes with IR (geneswith zero expression value in at least 50% of the samples were filtered out in the data filtering step)., After correction for multiple testing using the Benjamin eHochberg method (false discovery rate FDR),  none of the investigated geneswere signi ficant after the correction., Based on the method- ology presented by Shi et al. 40we ranked the genes by the absolute value of the log odds ratio (logOR) and selected thetop 100 genes signi ficantly associated with IR (threshold, jlogOR j/C210.23)., Out of the 100 genes ( Supplementary Table S8) 77 were associated with response and 23 were associ- ated with resistance to ICB therapy., We de fined the PredictIO signature as the ratio of the GSVA 37signatures composed of the response and the resistance genes as described, PredictIO 14GSVA Response Genes=GSVA Resistance Genes., Composition of the ICB validation cohort From October 2020 to June 2022 we collected additional independent datasets that were not included in our first literature scan or were freshly released from the scienti fic community to validate our findings., During this process we collected seven cohorts of ICB-treated patients (six adjuvant and one neoadjuvant study) with available transcriptomic data ( Supplementary Table S9 , available at https, //doi.org/ 10.1016/j.annonc.2022.08.084 ),  two melanoma (Puch41,  Gide42), one gastric (Kim43),  one esophageal (Van Den Ende44),  one renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (Shiuan45), one pan- cancer (INSPIRE46) and one pancreatic cohort (Padron47)., Process RNA-seq data from the Puch41S h i u a n45, Van Den Ende44and Padron47studies were directly obtained from theAnnals of Oncology Y. Bareche et al., 1306 https //doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2022.08.084 Volume 33 -Issue 12 -2022 corresponding publication., For the Gide42I N S P I R E46and Kim43studies, transcript abundance was quanti fied from the fastq files through the Salmon (v1.4.0)31program., Gene-level TPM data were then obtained from the estimated transcriptabundance level with tximport (v.1.20.0) R package., Whole-exome sequencing (WES) reads from the INSPIRE and Kim studies were aligned to the reference humangenome GRCh38 using bwa (v.0.7.17) 48aligner with default parameter settings., Somatic mutation calls were generatedfrom matched normal and tumor BAM files using Strelka (v.2.9.10) 49variant caller., Somatic mutations with a variant allele frequency >10% and a coverage >20 reads were kept and annotated using snpEFF (v.5.0e).50 T-cell dysfunction score analysis T-cell dysfunction score was computed as described in Jiang et al.18Briefly, we computed the average expression of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) signature composed of CD8A , CD8B , GZMA , GZMB and PRF1 ., From the 29 curated The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer type with at least 100patients we identi fied a trend or a signi ficant association of CTL levels toward a good OS in 7 TCGA cancer types, breast(BRCA),  cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC),  head eneck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), ovarian (OV),  sarcoma(SARC), skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC)., We applied a Cox proportional hazards (Cox-PH) survival regression to assess how a speci fic gene from the PredictIO interacts with the association be-tween CTL levels and survival outcome.The Cox-PH model wasalso corrected for patients age and sex clinical information.We extracted the log hazard ratio (logHR) and the corresponding P value of the interaction test and de fined it as T-cell dysfunction score., For each gene we derived a pan-cancer T-cell dysfunc- tion score by computing a meta-analysis of the T-cell dysfunction scores in the seven TCGA studies., Mouse model RNA-sequencing data Raw RNA-sequencing data of pretreatment AB1 (mesothe- lioma) and Renca (kidney cancer) tumors in BALB/c miceboth treated with anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-L1 were down- loaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Infor- mation (NCBI) repository (BioProject, PRJNA481876)., 51This cohort is composed of 24 samples from AB1 pretreatmenttumors (12 responders 12 non-responders) and 24 samplesfrom Renca pretreatment tumors (12 responders, 12 non-responders)., The abundance of transcripts was quanti fied from the fastq files through the Salmon (v1.4.0) 31program., Gene-level TPM data were then obtained from the esti- mated transcript abundance level with tximport (v.1.20.0) R package., Affymetrix (Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array) GE for 90 melanoma tumors52arising from an Hgftg Cdk4R24C/R24C genetically engineered mouse model treated with an anti-mouse PD-L1 antibody was retrieved from the GeneExpression Omnibus (GEO) portal (GSE172320)., Data werenormalized using the Robust Multichip Average method.Linear modeling was carried out using Limma s lmFit function., Processed TPM expression data of 16 orthotopic E0771 tumors [triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)] from micetreated with an anti-PD-1 antibody were retrieved from Chenet al., 53The abundance of transcripts was quanti fied from the fastq files through the Salmon (v1.4.0)31program., Gene-level TPM data were then obtained from the estimated transcriptabundance level with tximport (v.1.20.0) R package., Pan-cancer TCGA analysis TCGA 54RNA-seq raw count expression data from 29 cancer types were downloaded from the Xena ( https, //xena.ucsc., edu/ ) repository.55 56Gene-level TPM data were then ob- tained from the estimated transcript abundance level withtximport (v.1.20.0) R package., This dataset is composed of10 543 cancer samples from 29 cancer types (TCGA). TCGA-GTEX analysis Uniformly realigned and re-called TPM GE dataset for all TCGA 54and Genotype eTissue Expression (GTEx)57samples was downloaded from the Xena ( https, //xena.ucsc.edu/ ) repository.55, 56This dataset is composed of 9547 cancer samples from 28 cancer types (TCGA) and 7408 healthy samples from 30 tissue types across nearly 1000 individuals(GTEx)., Immune cell population estimated from TCGAsamples was obtained from Saltz et al. 58 59 Proteineprotein interaction network construction and gene function and pathway enrichment analysis We investigated gene interaction using the STRING60data- base to assess how proteins from PredictIO were interactingbetween each other., Only interactions with con fidence scores /C210.15 were kept. Functional gene ontology enrich- ment analysis was then carried out on the EnrichR web application ( https, //maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/ )., 39 Single-cell data analysis Single-cell expression data from the 73 studies for F2RL1 and RBFOX2 were retrieved from the TISCH platform ( tisch., comp-genomics.org/ ).61 Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics are reported as percentages for cate- gorical variables and the median and interquartile range (IQR)for continuous variables., Comparisons between two categor-ical variables were assessed using Fisher se x a c tt e s t .D i f f e r - ences between two continuous variables were assessed using Wilcoxon rank sum test (with permutation test if the number of samples was <10)., Association of speci fic biomarkers with IR was assessed using a logistic regression model. Associationof speci fic biomarkers with ICB survival (either PFS or OS) was assessed using Cox proportional hazards model to assess thediscrimination or separation of a survival model., To improvereproducibility the results of individual independent studieswere pooled using random-effects meta-analysis with inverseY., Bareche et al.

No statistically sig- nificant publication bias was observed (data not shown). KaplaneMeier curves and log-rank (Mantel eCox) tests were conducted for PredictIO (as categorical variable) survivalanalysis., All analyses were carried out on the R platform(version 3.6.3). When needed, Pvalues were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini eHochberg (FDR) method. Associations were deemed statistically signi ficant for Pvalues and/or FDR /C200.05. PredictIO web application PredictIO web application is a web-based tool that enables researchers to explore the gene signatures in the 25 studies(Explore feature) and to submit real-time gene signatureanalysis (Biomarker Evaluation feature)., The Explore feature allows researchers to explore pre- computed gene signatures by simply entering the modeland outcome of the pre-computed data.To use the BiomarkerEvaluation feature, a user inputs (i) a list of genes,  (ii) datatypes to be analyzed (single-nucleotide variant, copy numberalteration or expressions),  (iii) clinical data filters such as sex, tumor types and treatment types,  and (iv) an email to receiveresults., Once the analysis is complete, the user receives an email with a link to the analysis results page. The back-end of the web application is built with Flask a python-based web application framework, and the front-end is built with ReactJS., The back-end uses scripts writ-ten in R to carry out the real-time gene signature analysis and SendGrid to send analysis completion emails to users.The interactive data visualization features on the front-endare implemented using D3.js and Plotly.js., RESULTS Compendium of ICB genomic and clinical data for meta- analysis We collected and aggregated data from 3648 patients with advanced solid tumors treated with ICB, divided into thediscovery and validation cohorts ( Supplementary Figure S1 ,  available at https, //doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2022.08.084 )., In the discovery cohort the main tumor types were mela-noma (26%),  lung (17.9%), clear-cell RCC (16.4%) and uro-thelial cancer (10.4%)., The majority of patients (79.8%)received an anti-PD-(L)1 mAb 9.8% received an anti-CTLA-4mAb therapy and 10.4% received a combination of anti-PD-(L)1 and anti-CTLA-4 mAbs., Within the cohort, 35.9% ofpatients were identi fied as responders. The median PFS andOS were 4.9 and 18 months, respectively ( Table 1 ). We defined logOR and logHR as the natural logarithm of, respectively, the OR and the HR. OR refers to the ratio of the odds of NR and HR refers to the ratio of the hazard ratesof progression or death., Of note sex was not signi ficantly associated with outcomes ( Supplementary Figure S2 A, available at https, //doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2022.08.084 ) and a weak but signi ficant association of age (as contin- uous) with IR was observed (logOR 14/C0 0.02, 95% con fi- dence interval (CI) /C00.03 to /C00.01,  P140.001) (Supplementary Figure S2 B, available at https, //doi.org/10., 1016/j.annonc.2022.08.084 ). TMB is a strong predictive pan-cancer biomarker of ICB responses We investigated the pan-cancer predictive value of TMB in our data compendium., TMB was signi ficantly associated with improved IR (logOR 14/C0 1.15 95% CI /C01.59 to /C00.70, P<0.001,  Figure 1 A),  irrespective of the type of variable Table 1., Clinicopathological characteristics of the discovery cohort Total EXP SNV Studies n(%) 26 (100) 21 (80.8) 17 (65.4) No., of patients 3648 1393 3066 Age years Median age (IQR)61 (54-70) 62 (55-69) 61 (53-70) NA (%) 979 (26.8) 802 (57.6) 647 (21.1) Sex Female (%) 1360 (37.3) 448 (32.2) 1165 (38) Male (%) 1963 (53.8) 674 (48.4) 1697 (55.3) NA (%) 325 (8.9) 271 (19.5) 204 (6.7) Primary Melanoma (%) 949 (26) 482 (34.6) 737 (24) Lung (%) 652 (17.9) 144 (10.3) 540 (17.6) Kidney (%) 597 (16.4) 293 (21) 495 (16.1)Bladder (%) 379 (10.4) 194 (13.9) 337 (11)HNC (%) 171 (4.7) 14 (1) 171 (5.6) Unknown (%) 166 (4.6) 39 (2.8) 160 (5.2) Colon (%) 130 (3.6) 0 (0) 130 (4.2)Brain (%) 117 (3.2) 0 (0) 117 (3.8)Ureteral (%) 102 (2.8) 51 (3.7) 97 (3.2)Esophagus (%) 83 (2.3) 0 (0) 83 (2.7) Breast (%) 53 (1.5) 7 (0.5) 53 (1.7) Stomach (%) 46 (1.3) 0 (0) 46 (1.5)Pancreas (%) 45 (1.2) 45 (3.2) 0 (0)Gastric (%) 45 (1.2) 45 (3.2) 42 (1.4) Esophageal (%) 35 (1) 35 (2.5) 0 (0) Drug treatmentPD-1/PD-L1 (%) 2912 (79.8) 1255 (90.1) 2333 (76.1) CTLA-4 (%) 356 (9.8) 66 (4.7) 356 (11.6) Combo (%) 380 (10.4) 72 (5.2) 377 (12.3) Response No response (%) 1211 (64.1) 737 (66) 900 (63.2) Response (%) 677 (35.9) 379 (34) 523 (36.8)Total (%) 1888 (51.8) 1116 (80.1) 1423 (46.4) PFS (months) No progression (%)457 (29.0) 193 (24.5) 361 (30.1) Progressed (%) 1120 (71.0) 595 (75.5) 840 (69.9) Total (%) 1577 (43.2) 788 (56.6) 1201 (39.2) Median PFS 4.85 4.11 4.83IQR PFS 4.27-5.49 3.58-5.33 4.18-5.51 OS (months) Alive (%) 1391 (43.2) 377 (35.5) 1296 (44.7) Dead (%) 1829 (56.8) 684 (64.5) 1606 (55.3)Total (%) 3220 (88.3) 1061 (76.2) 2902 (94.7)Median OS 18 15.34 19IQR OS 16.52-19.29 13.38-17.58 17.08-20.7 CTLA-4, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4,  EXP ,  expression data,  HNC,  head and neck cancer,  IQR, interquartile range,  NA,  not available,  OS,  overall survival,  PD-1, pro- grammed cell death protein 1,  PD-L1,  programmed death-ligand 1,  PFS, progression-free survival,  SNV,  single-nucleotide variant.Annals of Oncology Y.

Of note we observed signi ficant heterogeneity for TMB as a biomarker of PFS (as a cate-gorical variable using the median, I 21458%,  Q Pvalue 14 0.008)., Tumor subtype analysis further showed that TMB was not associated with improved response in RCC patients, supporting previous studies., 1432, 66Together, our results confirmed that TMB is a robust biomarker of IR and survival in different solid malignancies, except for RCC., Pan-cancer testing of gene signatures associated with ICB responses We next evaluated the robustness of candidate pretreat- ment GE signatures previously reported to be associatedwith increased sensitivity or resistance to ICB therapy(Supplementary Tables S3-S5 , available at https, //doi.org/ 10.1016/j.annonc.2022.08.084 )., We identi fiedfive clusters of signatures sharing similar genes ( Figure 2 A) three clus- ters related to chemokine,  cytokine and T-cell receptorsignaling pathways, one related to antigen-presenting ma-chinery,  one heterogeneous cluster related to cell cycle, pathways in cancer and extracellular matrix receptor., Wethen investigated the prognostic value of these signaturesin our discovery cohort ( Figure 2 B and C)., All the curated signatures were z-scaled transformed to allow for effect-size comparison. Of note the IPRES and the Macrophage sig-natures were not investigated in our meta-analysis due to alow number of genes present in the discovery cohort., Outof 37 remaining curated signatures 22 (59%) were signi fi- cantly associated after correction for multiple testing withat least one clinical outcome at pan-cancer level (FDR < 0.05, Figure 2 B and Supplementary Tables S6 and S7, available at https, //doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2022.08.084 )., Ten ICB-sensitive signatures (i.e. signal transducer andactivator of transcription 1 (STAT1) In flammatory,  IRG_Ay- ers,  TIS,  TLS, T_cell_in flamed,  PDL1,  IFNG, CD8_Jiang and CYT) were signi ficantly associated with all three clinical outcomes (i.e., response, PFS and OS). Out of 12 ICB- resistance signatures 4 (33%) were signi ficantly associated with at least one clinical outcome (PTEN_MITF, T-cellexclusion,  C_ECM and COX_IS,  Figure 2 B)., PTEN_MITF was the only signature signi ficantly associated with all three clinical outcomes ( Figure 2 B)., Notably in contrast to ICB- sensitive signatures, ICB-resistance signatures were notstrongly correlated to each other, re flecting more diverse biological pathways ( Supplementary Figure S3 ,  available at https, //doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2022.08.084 )., Subgroup analysis showed similar patterns of predictive association of GE signatures in melanoma and lung cancer(Figure 2 C)., In RCC tumors however, several GE signatures displayed an opposite predictive association compared topan-cancer, melanoma or lung cancer ( Figure 2 C)., For instance antigen-presenting machinery signatures (APM_Thompson and APM_Wang) were signi ficantly associated with worse OS in RCC meta-analysis ( Figure 2 )., Identi fication of genes associated with ICB response To gain more insight into the mechanism of response and resistance to ICB therapy, we carried out a de novo meta- analysis of the 12 329 genes present at least in 12 of the14 transcriptomic curated studies., We ranked the genesbased on their logOR and derived signatures from the top 20up to the top 200 genes to investigate their association withIR (Supplementary Figure S4 A, available at https, //doi.org/10., 1016/j.annonc.2022.08.084 ).

Out of the top 100 genes 77 were associated withICB sensitivity and 23 were associated with ICB resistance atthe pan-cancer level., Enrichment analysis for gene ontologyshowed that genes associated with ICB sensitivity wereassociated with immune response regulation ( Supplementary Figure S4 B and C, available at https, //doi.org/10.1016/j., annonc.2022.08.084 ) whereas ICB-resistance genes were associated with epithelial emesenchymal transition (EMT) (Supplementary Figure S4 B-D, available at https, //doi.org/10., 1016/j.annonc.2022.08.084 ). We then evaluated the predictive value of the PredictIO signature. We de fined the PredictIO signature as the ratio of the GSVA 37signatures composed of the response and the resistance genes as described, PredictIO 14GSVA Response Genes=GSVA Resistance Genes.Wefirstly investigated whether PredictIO was associated with IR in our discovery cohort and found signi ficant and stronger association with IR than any other investigatedsignature ( Supplementary Figure S4 E, available at https, // doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2022.08.084 )., We then assessed the prognostic association of our signature in ICB-treatedpreclinical cancer models., In four distinct mouse models(mesothelioma RCC,  melanoma and TNBC) treated with ICBtherapy, PredictIO score obtained from pretreatment sam- ples showed consistent ability to stratify sensitive from resistant mice ( Figure 3 B), with areas under the curve (AUCs) ranging from 0.78 to 0.95 ( Supplementary Figure S4 F, available at https, //doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc., 2022.08.084 ).

Remarkably when compared to other candidate GE signatures, PredictIO was the mostrobust predictor of IR,  with signi ficantly higher AUC values (median AUC, 0.83,  IQR,  0.76-0.85,  Figure 3 C),  except for CYT and CD8_Jiang signatures, which had a larger variability., Incohorts with available survival data (INSPIRE 46and Gide42) PredictIO further exhibited a strong and signi ficant associa- tion with PFS and OS ( Figure 3 D)., Of interest we investigated the prognostic value of PredictIO through a meta-analysis of>10 000 non-ICB-treated patients from 29 cancer types (Supplementary Figure S5 , available at https, //doi.org/10., 1016/j.annonc.2022.08.084 ). We found that PredictIO was not signi ficantly associated with prognosis (FDR 140.097) showing that the observed association with IR is speci fict o the immunotherapy setting.We also investigated individuallythe prognostic value of each gene composing PredictIO and found that only 3 out of the 100 genes were signi ficantly associated with prognosis, namely RAB42,  FJX1 and SORCS2(Supplementary Figure S6 ,  available at https, //doi.org/10., 1016/j.annonc.2022.08.084 ). In the discovery cohort PredictIO also showed a significantly higher AUC (median AUC,  0.73, 95% CI 0.64- 0.77) compared to TMB (median AUC,  0.60,  95% CI 0.57- 0.64) ( P140.001, Figure 3 E)., PredictIO (as continuous) showed higher AUC value than TMB (as continuous) inthe pan-cancer INSPIRE trial 46(Figure 3 F) and the gastric Kim trial43(Figure 3 H)., Notably IR prediction sensitivity was consistently higher for PredictIO (top quartile)versus TMB (10 TMB/Mb) in these two trials ( Figure 3 G and I) with signi ficant differences in the INSPIRE study (21% versus 71%, two-sided Fisher P140.023)., Overall the top-quartile value of PredictIO was able to stratifyVariable RBFOX2 F2RL1WDR86 GALNT5 SOX9LogOR 0.47 0.3 0.180.150.1195% CI (0.09 -0.85) (0.02 to 0.61) (0.27 to 0.64) (0.23 to 0.52) (0.23 to 0.44)P value 0.015 0.0660.425 0.443 0.531Heterogeneity 0.04 0 0.280.21 0Het., P value 0.398 0.51 0.211 0.273 0.569 0.3 0 0.7 Combined logOR (95% CI)Variable WDR86 RBFOX2GALNT5 F2RL1 SOX9LogOR 0.260.260.25 0.24 0.2495% CI (0.08-0.44)(0.09-0.42)(0.08-0.42) (0.05-0.43) (0.07-0.4)P value 0.004 0.0030.004 0.015 0.005Heterogeneity 000 0.23 0.19Het., P value 0.762 0.5370.734 0.197 0.238 0.2 0 0.5 Combined logOR (95% CI) 2 1 0 1 2 Z-scoreLog10 ( P value)F2RL1 GALNT5RBFOX2 SOX9WDR86 RAB11FIP4T-cell dysfunction score 1.0 0.8Progression-free survival Progression-free survival Progression-free survival Progression-free survivalInspire F2RL1 low F2RL1 highF2RL1 low F2RL1 high Logrank P = 8.5E03 0 6 12 18 24 Time (months) No., at risk Low HighLow HighLow HighLow High49 2615 413 39 27 2RBFOX2 low RBFOX2 high Logrank P = 8.2E04 0 6 12 18 24 Time (months) No., at risk 43 2314 212 17 16 0Inspire Gide Logrank P = 5.5E03 0 6 12 18 24 Time (months) No. at risk 15 15 27 1418 42 213 1Logrank P = 3.7E01RBFOX2 low RBFOX2 high 0 6 12 18 24 Time (months) No., at risk 27 1415 713 413 411 3Gide DAB ECDiscovery cohort Validation cohort 0.00.51.01.52.02.5 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.01.0 0.8 0.60.4 0.2 0.01.0 0.8 0.60.4 0.2 0.01.0 0.8 0.6 0.40.20.0 Figure 4., F2RL1 and RBFOX2 as potential therapeutic targets to overcome immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) resistance., (A) Volcano plot summarizing the meta- analysis of the T-cell dysfunction score from the genes identi fied in PredictIO,  in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) studies (BRCA dbreast, CESC dcervical squamous cell carcinoma,  HNSC dheadeneck squamous cell carcinoma,  OV dovarian, SARC dsarcoma,  SKCM dskin cutaneous melanoma,  UCEC duterine corpus endometrial carcinoma)., The x- and y-axis represent, respectively, the z-score and the /C0log10(FDR).

Bareche et al., 1312 https //doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2022.08.084 Volume 33 -Issue 12 -2022 patients to identify 71% and 69% of ICB responders, respectively,  in the INSPIRE and Kim studies., In contrast TMB was only able to reach 21% and 46% sensitivity with 10 TMB/Mb as cut-points, respectively,  in theINSPIRE and Kim studies., Taken together our results highlight the strong and robust prognostic value of the PredictIO gene signature andits potential clinical relevance as compared to the currentstandard., Identi fication of potential targets to overcome ICB resistance We next sought to identify novel therapeutic targets to overcome ICB resistance., For this we calculated the T-celldysfunction score for each gene within the PredictIOsignature and compared their individual predictive value in the AB1 and Renca models., Described by Jiang et al. 18the T-cell dysfunction score measures the impact of a givengene on the prognostic value of a CTL GE signature (CTL, composed of CD8A , CD8B , GZMA , GZMB and PRF1 ) in ICB- naive tumors., T-cell dysfunction scores were computed inTCGA datasets where the CTL signature was signi ficantly associated with better OS ( Figure 4 )., Meta-analysis of these studies identi fiedfive PredictIO genes signi ficantly associ- ated with a high T-cell dysfunction score, F2RL1 , WDR86 ,  RBFOX2 , GALNT5 and SOX9 (Figure 4 A)., Amongst these F2RL1,  GALNT5, RBFOX2 and SOX9 were further associated with resistance in at least one of the four ICB-treated pre-clinical models ( Supplementary Figure S7 , available at https, //doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2022.08.084 )., RBFOX2 (logOR 140.47 95% CI 0.09-0.85,  P140.015) and F2RL1 (logOR 140.30,  95% CI /C00.02 to 0.61, P140.066) were the only genes associated with worse IR in our discovery and validation cohorts ( Figure 4 B and C and Supplementary Figure S8 A and B, available at https, //doi.org/10.1016/j., annonc.2022.08.084 ). F2RL1  encoding for the protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2), was consistently overexpressed in cancer tissues, except for skin ( Supplementary Figure S8 C, available at https, //doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2022.08.084 )., RBFOX2  encoding for an RNA-binding protein essential for EMT- driven alternative splicing, 67was more homogeneously expressed,  although signi ficantly increased in some malig- nancies, such as pancreas,  lung,  kidney and breast cancer(Supplementary Figure S8 D,  available at https, //doi.org/10., 1016/j.annonc.2022.08.084 ). Further supporting our T-cell dysfunction analysis F2RL1 and RBFOX2 were negatively associated with CD8 T cells and M2 macrophages and positively correlated with M2 macrophages ( Supplementary Figure S8 E and F, available at https, //doi.org/10.1016/j., annonc.2022.08.084 ). Lastly we investigated F2RL1 and RBFOX2 expression in 28 tumor types from 72 single-cellstudies and identi fied that these two genes were mainly expressed on malignant and fibroblast cells ( Supplementary Figure S8 G and H, available at https, //doi.org/10.1016/j., annonc.2022.08.084 ).Interactive mining of biomarkers for ICB response To facilitate the investigation of individual genes and gene signatures in ICB-treated patients, we developed PredictIO., ca an open-source cloud-based web application composed of three interactive modules, Pre-Computed Signatures,  Biomarker Evaluation and PredictIO., The first module will allow users to graphically explore the entire signatureanalysis presented in this manuscript., With the BiomarkerEvaluation module users will investigate the predictivevalue of their own gene/signatures, computed either usingthe weighted mean or the GSVA method (depending on ifthe signature includes coef ficient or not), as described in this manuscript., Brie fly users can assess the relationship of their signature with published curated signatures (as showninFigure 2 A) and explore the association of a speci fic biomarker with IR, PFS and OS in the 26 studies encom-passing >3600 patients with RNA-seq and/or targeted gene sequencing/WES available., Amongst these two modulesusers can download all the generated figures in high reso- lution, the tables used to generate them along with the selected sequencing and clinical information to maximize research transparency and reproducibility., Finally usingthe last module, clinicians and researchers will be able toupload patients RNA-seq data to compute the PredictIO score., DISCUSSION Assessing the validity and reproducibility of predictive GE signatures of IR remains an open challenge due to limitedaccess to pharmacogenomic data for immunotherapies., Inthis study we carried out the largest comparative analysisto date of candidate genomics and transcriptomic bio-markers of IRs in a pan-cancer cohort of over 3600 patients., At the genomic level we validated that high TMB was significantly associated with better IRs across cancer in- dications, with the exception of kidney cancer,  as previouslyreported., 1432, 66At the transcriptomic level, only approxi- mately half of curated GE signatures (22 out of 37, 59%)were signi ficantly associated with pan-cancer IRs., Five ICB- sensitive signatures (APM_Wang CYT,  APM_Thompson, M1and CD8_Jiang) were signi ficantly associated with pan- cancer response in the discovery cohort and displayed a median AUC >0.70 in validation cohorts., Yet our study demonstrated the superior predictive impact of a novel GE signature dPredictIO dderived from our de novo pan-cancer analysis., Our premise was that a large pan-cancer analysis would be ideal to uncover criticalpathways of ICB resistance, and that small single tumor typecohorts may bias toward the identi fication of prognostic genes irrespective of their immune impact., PredictIO was more robust and more statistically signi ficant than all the other curated GE signatures in our validation pan-cancercohort, with the highest median AUC (median AUC,  0.81, 95% CI 0.76-0.86)., Notably PredictIO allowed for betterpatient strati fication of response than TMB in the two phase II studies of pembrolizumab in advanced solid tumors(INSPIRE) 46and advanced gastric tumors (Kim), 43with aY., Bareche et al. Annals of Oncology Volume 33 -Issue 12 -2022 https //doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2022.08.084 1313 sensitivity of w70%, as compared with TMB (10 TMB/Mb) that had at best a sensitivity of 46%., A unique feature of PredictIO compared to other signa- tures, is that it is composed of a mix of genes associatedwith either ICB sensitivity (77%) or resistance (23%)., Touncover novel therapeutic targets of cancer immuno-therapy we cross-analyzed the PredictIO signature with twoadditional datasets, a compendium of TCGA studies tocompute T-cell dysfunction scores 18and transcriptomic profiles of mouse tumors associated with response or resistance to dual PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade.51-53Five PredictIO genes were concurrently associated with a high T-celldysfunction score ( F2RL1 , WDR86 , RBFOX2 , GALNT5 and SOX9 ), amongst which only F2RL1 and RBFOX2 were asso- ciated with worse IR in our discovery and validation cohorts., RBFOX2 is an RNA-binding protein that promotes alter- native splicing. In response to transforming growth factor(TGF)- bsignaling RBFOX2 together with another RNA- binding protein,  PCBP1, promote alternate splicing of TAK1 pre-messenger RNA, a required step for TGF- b- induced EMT.68Induction of EMT further up-regulates RBFOX2 expression to drive mesenchymal tissue-speci fic splicing.67, 69Depletion of RBFOX2 in mesenchymal tumor cells reduces cell invasion and promotes epithelial pheno-type., 6770Since RBFOX proteins regulate a wide range of neurodevelopmental functions, 71targeting RBFOX2 may be ill-advised., One could envision however, targeting the splicing of TAK1 by RBFOX2 with splice-switching oligonu-cleotides, as proposed by Tripathi et al., 68This approach has been successfully used to induce TAK1 isoform switching inmouse livers. 72Furthermore recent studies demonstrated in preclinical models the bene fit of ICB therapy in combi- nation with pharmacological perturbation of splicing mod-ulators, which induce anti-viral immune response through immunogenic splicing-derived neoepitopes., 7374 F2RL1 encodes for PAR2, a G-protein-coupled receptor that responds to activated proteases including trypsin, tis-sue kallikreins,  mast cell tryptase,  cathepsins, neutrophilelastase and tissue factor (TF)/factor (F) VIIa and Xa com-plexes involved in coagulation., PAR2 is increased by in-flammatory stimuli and the observation that mice de ficient in PAR2 are protected from in flammatory arthritis and pronociceptive actions drove the development of selective antagonists for the treatment of rheumatic diseases andchronic pain (NCT04198558)., 75-77In response to in flam- matory stimuli PAR2 has been shown to suppress type Iinterferon (IFN) responses and STAT1 signaling, 78and po- larizes human macrophages toward an M2-like pheno-type., 79Interestingly a recent study demonstrated that inhibiting the protease FXa,  which activates PAR2, signi fi- cantly improved ICB therapy in a mouse model of cancer through macrophage reprogramming.80PAR2 signaling thus appears as a critical pathway of tumor immune evasion andmay represent a novel therapeutic target to overcome ICBresistance., Importantly PAR2 antagonists are currently inclinical development and could be rapidly tested in com-bination with ICB in cancer patients.The other PredictIO genes concurrently associated with a high T-cell dysfunction score were WDR86 , GALNT5 and SOX9 .WDR86 is a poorly characterized gene., GALNT5 en- codes an N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase that catalyzesglycosylation of Golgi proteins and may be involved inpromoting EMT., 81The high mobility group transcription factor SOX9 has also been associated with EMT and onco- genesis, 82, 83and may decreased type I IFN responses.84 Recognizing the potential clinical value of the generated data for the scienti fic community, we developed PredictIO (PredictIO.ca ), an open-source cloud-based web application allowing users to investigate the association of individualgenes and signatures with IR and ICB resistance., Otherplatforms such as the one developed by the TIDE team(tide.dfci.harvard.edu ) 18, 24or the Cancer Research Institute (CRI) iAtlas ( www.cri-iatlas.org ), 25already allow users to investigate the predictive value of their biomarker of in-terest separately within each study., Here we proposed a more clinically impactful approach granting users the ability to carry out comprehensive meta-analyses of response, PFSand OS of their biomarker of interest (expression,  mutationor copy number)., Altogether this web application will bringhigh-impact knowledge to the community which could leadto the development of new clinical targets aiming toimprove response in ICB therapy., Our study has several limitations. Our pan-cancer cohort was composed of heterogeneous studies with different ICB drug therapies and variability in patient populationincluding in terms of lines of prior therapy., Moreover, thesestudies were composed of distinct sequencing technologyand bioinformatics processing. In our meta-analysis, we didnot observe any signi ficant heterogeneity from these last two factors. The main source of heterogeneity was origi-nating from the various cancer types. Our curated dataset was mainly composed of melanoma lung and kidney cancer and there is a need to pursue curating new studies to in-crease data for other tumor types., Another limitation of thisstudy is the fact that we mainly focused on the tran-scriptomic pro files and left out some putative interesting genomic alterations., Several previously publishedstudies 1314, 32, 85, 86had already investigated the genomic alterations associated with response or resistance to ICB with only limited success., Finally, association between gene(s) and IR does not prove a causative role of thesegenes. In conclusion our study highlights the relative value and limitations of previously reported GE signatures in theirability to predict IR, and demonstrated the power of de novo pan-cancer meta-analysis of GE pro files in order to bring forth novel predictive biomarkers and uncover po- tential novel therapeutic targets in immuno-oncology., FUNDING This work was supported by a research grant (Immuno- therapy network iTNT) from the Terry Fox Research Insti-tute (JS and BHK) (no grant number), by a research grant(ODAC competition) funded by Genome Quebec, theAnnals of Oncology Y.

If individual patient data was not publicly available, the authors requested it from the corresponding authors of the studies.\n\n2. **Transcriptomic Data Processing**: \n   - The processed transcriptomic profiles were composed of log2-transformed transcripts per million (TPM) data.\n   - For raw sequencing data, transcript abundance was quantified from fastq files using the Salmon software. Gene-level TPM data were then obtained from the estimated transcript abundance using the `tximport` R package.\n   - If raw count or TPM data were available directly from publications, those were used. For FPKM data, a conversion to TPM was performed using a specific formula.\n\n3. **Filtering**: Genes with zero expression values in at least 50% of the samples were filtered out to reduce noise in the data.\n\n4. **Censoring of Survival Data**: Due to variability in clinical follow-up between studies, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) data were censored at 36 and 24 months, respectively.\n\n5. **Duplication Removal**: The authors compared patients across datasets to remove any potential duplicates. For mutational profiles, Cohen's kappa score was used to define samples from the same patient, while Spearman correlation was used for transcriptomic profiles.\n\n6. **Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) Computation**: TMB was computed per megabase based on non-synonymous mutations, and the median was used as a cut-point to assess low and high TMB across tumor types.\n\n7. **Gene Signature Computation**: Gene signatures were computed using gene set variation analysis (GSVA) enrichment scores, and z-score transformation was applied to the genes of each signature before computation.\n\nThese steps ensured that the data was standardized, cleaned, and appropriately processed for subsequent analysis and meta-analysis within the study."
