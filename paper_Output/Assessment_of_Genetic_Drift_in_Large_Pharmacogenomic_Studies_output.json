the genomic integrity of these cells throughout a study is a costly endeavor that is commonlyforgone., Here we validate the identity of cancer cell lines in three pharmacogenomic studies and screenfor genetic drift within and between datasets., Using SNP data from these datasets encompassing 1 497 unique cell lines and 63 unique pharmacological compounds, we show that genetic drift is widely prevalent in almost all cell lines with a median of 4.5%6.1% of the total genome size drifted between any two isogeniccell lines., This study highlights the need for molecular profiling of cell lines to minimize the effects ofpassaging or misidentification in biomedical studies., We developed the CCLid web application availableat www.cclid.ca, to allow users to screen the genomic profiles of their cell lines against these datasets.A record of this papers transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental Information., INTRODUCTION Cell lines are adequate model systems when exploring the link between genetic variation and pharmacological response, how- ever, their usage in biomedical research is plagued by issues of misidentification and genetic instability ( Freedman et al., 2015 ,  Korch and Varella-Garcia,  2018 , Vaughan et al.,  2017 )., Reviews by Korch and Varella-Garcia ( Korch and Varella-Garcia 2018 ) illustrate the prevalence of these issues and present guidelinesto ensure cell line authentication and integrity throughout astudy., Common issues regarding ambiguous cell line annota- tions and their usage in biomedical research can be addressed by referencing the Cellosaurus knowledge resource ( Bairoch, 2018 ), while cell line identity can be validated using the cell line authentication using short tandem repeat (CLASTR) web portal (Robin et al., 2020 )., Despite these resources short tandem re- peats are more susceptible to genetic drift and mismatch repair deficiencies than the use of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) ( Fan and Chu, 2007 , Korch et al.,  2012 , Much et al.,  2014 ), and there are limited resources available to monitor the stability of cell lines throughout and between studies ( Ben-David et al., 2018 )., Genetic instability is a hallmark of cancer that is particularly heightened in cancer cell lines thus,  affecting the stability of genomic profiles across and between studies ( Ben-Davidet al., 2018 , Kleensang et al.,  2016 )., Ben-David et al. examined the extent of genetic drift between 106 cell lines shared between the Broad Institute (Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia [CCLE]) andthe Sanger Institute (Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer [GDSC])., In their study they reported an estimated 19% discor- dance in non-silent mutations and 26% (range of 7%99%)discordance in copy-number variants (CNVs)., More focused an- alyses on genetic stability of a single cell line (MCF-7 A549, and HeLa) show that subclonal populations with different genomicbackgrounds exist at the cell bank level ( Kleensang et al., 2016 ), and that passaging or inter-laboratory effects can amplify genetic drift in these cell lines ( Ben-David et al., 2018 , Kleensang et al.,  2016 , Liu et al.,  2019 )., More concerning is that these insta- bilities can lead to a plethora of functional consequences such as morphological differences, altered proliferative capacity,  a diverse gene expression pattern, variable responses to alleviateproteotoxic stress, and a major impact on drug response ( Ben- David et al.,  2018 , Kleensang et al.,  2016 , Liu et al.,  2019 )., Ben-David et al. contributed to genetic stability issue by devel-oping the web portal Cell STRAINER (strain instability profiler) (Ben-David et al., 2018 ), which allows users to compare the copy-number profile of their cell lines against CCLE ( Barretina et al., 2012 ) and flag discordant regions., Our study expands the work of Ben-David et al. by exploring the genetic identity and stability of 1497 cell lines used across Cell Systems 11, 393401,  October 21, 2020 a2020 Elsevier Inc. 393ll the three largest pharmacogenomic studies published to date, CCLE/CTRPv2,  GDSC, and the Genentech cell line screening initiative (gCSI) ( CCLE Consortium and GDSC Consortium, 2015 , Haibe-Kains et al.,  2013 , Hatzis et al.,  2014 , Haverty et al.,  2016 , Safikhani et al., 2016 )., In contrast to the method uti- lized by Cell STRAINER ( Ben-David et al. 2018 ), we use an SNP allelic-fraction method that allows us to leverage RNAsequencing (RNA-seq) data in addition to SNP array withineach dataset to screen for genetic stability both between and within each institution., Furthermore by comparing measures of chromosomal instability (CIN) and genetic drift to distancesbetween drug dose-response curves, we show that both mea- sures have a significant, albeit weak association with pharmaco- logical response for certain drugs., Thus our results support thenotion that the inherent karyotypic instability of cancer cell lines may have an adverse effect on the reproducibility of pharmaco- logical screens., RESULTSDatasets To quantify genetic instability of human cancer cell lines used inlarge-scale pharmacogenomic studies, we reprocessed 1, 006 publicly available Affymetrix SNP arrays from the GDSC ( Yang et al., 2013 ),  1, 213 from the CCLE project ( Barretina et al., 2012 ) as well as 668 Omni 2.5Million SNP arrays from the gCSI (Haverty et al.,  2016 )., Using the paired RNA-seq from CCLE GDSC, and gCSI we searched all datasets for both inter- andintra-institutional genotype concordance, genetic drift,  andpharmacological agreement ( Figure S1 )., Authentication of Cancer Cell Lines To ensure the identity of all cancer cell lines used across thethree datasets, we used 5, 701 SNPs uniformly scattered across the genome to check their genotypic identity., We did pairwise comparisons between the CCLE, GDSC, and gCSIpharmacogenomic datasets. While our predictions found numerous cases of isogenicity in differently annotated cell lines (Figure 1 , n CCLE-GDSC = 68,  n CCLE-Gcsi = 103,  and n GDSC-gCSI = 86), these were largely rectified by cross-referencing the Cello-saurus database ( Bairoch,  2018 )., After this correction we found that all datasets contained problematic cell lines, indicating known contamination or misidentification., We further correctedfor cell line pairs that were not directly linked in Cellosaurus (e.g. HCT-15 and DLD-1 share the same parental cell line but are not explicitly annotated as linked) and resulted in only 6cell lines in CCLE, 3 in GDSC,  and 11 in gCSI that were either misidentified (e.g., Hs-571.T in CCLE mapping to TOV-112D in GDSC and gCSI), known problematic with an unreported pair(e.g.,  cell line KE-97 pairing with KMS-18), have an unknown relation another cell line pair (e.g., HLC-1 and HMC-1-8 having different STR profiles with unknown relation), or simply misla-beled (e.g.,  DOR13 in gCSI is actually DOV13) ( Table S1 )., Overall given the scale of these initiatives, there was a commendable amount of concordance between cell lines with very few cases of misidentification or some unknown relation between cellline pairs., We next ensured the identity of cell lines from RNA-seq data generated from GDSC and CCLE. Of the 462 samples fromGDSC 19 samples had no matching counterpart in any dataset, and 4 matched cell lines of a different annotation or lineage (HAL- 01,  KPD,  CHL-1, and LB771-HNC) ( Table S2 )., Of the 711 sam- ples analyzed from CCLE 44 did not match any other cell lines, and 6 matched cell lines of different annotation or lineage (NCI- H1819,  LN-464,  U343,  HSSRB, HCC-1588,  and PLB-985)., Finally the CCRF-SB was the only cell line out of the 675 testedthat matched a cell line of a different annotation or lineage, CTV-1 found in the GDSC dataset., However the CTV-1 line is labeled as a likely misidentified in Cellosaurus ( https, //web.expasy.org/ cellosaurus/CVCL_1150 )., The imperfect concordance between genotype and gene expression datasets suggests the absence of DNA/RNA co-isolation and the possibility of genetic drift within individual datasets., Detection of Genetic Drift To investigate the potential of intra- and inter-institutional ge-netic drift in cell lines, we first quantified the amount of karyotypic discordances using log-R ratio (LRR) or B-allele frequency (BAF) alone between SNP-array-processed samples., We estimatedthe fraction of the genome that drifted between 586 isogenic cell lines between the GDSC and CCLE datasets using LRR ( Ta- ble S3 )., We found that most cell lines show evidence of karyo- typic drift as measured by the fraction of the genome drifted (k) using LRR (k LRR= 0.09  0.11), with one cell line exhibiting 72.6% of the genome being karyotypically different between da-tasets ( Figure 2 A)., Using BAF we found a significantly smaller portion of the genome exhibiting genetic drift (k BAF= 0.02  0.05) with one cell line exhibiting 60% of the genome drifted(Figure 2 A)., As a simple observation we found that the estimates made us- ing BAF were less sensitive than those made using LRR, which were capable of detecting abnormalities derived from subclonal-ity or heterogeneity ( Figure S2 )., While the majority of cases agreed upon regions drifted using LRR and BAF approaches (Figure 2 C) there were few cases with a large discrepancy be- tween LRR and BAF estimates ( Figure 2 A)., We identified that drift estimates using LRR were overly sensitive to the presence of subclonality or heterogeneity within a given cell line population(Figure S2 ) and that BAF estimates of drift were confounded by noise, especially in loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) regions ( Fig- ure 2 C)., Furthermore the step-like increase in ploidy of seg- ments does not directly translate to detectable differences inBAF (e.g., AAB /AAAB,  Figure 2 D) in highly aneuploidy cell lines with high ploidy,  such as JHOS-2., Given these limitations we sought to quantify how accurate BAF estimates of drift were when compared with LRR estimates., We assessed accuracy by detecting the minimum percent of the genome that is concordant in drifted/non-drifted regions be-tween BAF- and LRR-calculated drift profiles., We found that 90% of all cell line pairs have at least 78.4% of the drift profiles for the genome in concordance, 80% of all cell line pairs haveat least 85.3% concordance in drift profiles, and 70% of all cellline pairs have at least 89.4% concordance ( Figure 2 B)., These results highlight that despite the large discordances between ap- proaches seen in cell lines such as JHOS-2 and HCC1937 ( Fig- ures 2 D and 2E), these cases represent only a minority of cases, while the majority of drifted/non-drifted regions can be accu- rately called using BAF alone.ll Report 394 Cell Systems 11, 393401,  October 21,  2020 Figure 1., Concordance between Genotypes Using B-Allele Frequency Confusion matrices for predicted isogenicity (matching, M) and assumed isogenicity based on annotations were computed for each pairwise combinati on of datasets, the predicted isogenic lines with non-matching (NM) annotations were closely investigated by annotations from the Cellosaurus dataset t o look for synonymous cell lines (SS) or cell lines deriving from the same origins (OI/SO)., All cell lines with no obvious link (X) were further manually reviewed to look for associations and reported as misidentified (MI) for clear cases of misidentification/contamination or unknown (UNK) where there is not enough metada ta to make an informed decision.ll Report Cell Systems 11, 393401,  October 21,  2020 395 AB C D E Figure 2., Measures of Genetic Drift between GDSC and CCLE (A) Estimates of total genomic drift are plotted against each, one derived from the LRR and one from the BAF., Distributions of both estimates are repres ented as kernel density plots in the margins.

BAF (D) and one with high BAF and low LRR (E).ll Report 396 Cell Systems 11, 393401,  October 21,  2020 We then compared cell lines from gCSI and CCLE ( Table S3 )., Unlike our previous GDSC-CCLE comparison gCSI was analyzed using a different SNP-array platform, Omni 2.5Million as compared with Affymetrix SNP 6.0., Despite these differences we saw the same distribution of LRR drift and BAF as observed between GDSC and CCLE ( Figures S3 A and S3B), suggesting a platform-independent analysis and that similar levels of geneticdrift were observed across research institutions., Similarly weobserved poor concordance between BAF- and LRR-estimated drift, with extreme outliers representing different components, such as noise of the assay in Hs-294T ( Figure S3 C), or a highly aneuploid genome that does not translate well to BAF discor- dances, such as in HCC1599 ( Figure S3 D)., To look for evidence of intra-institutional genetic drift we first compared the BAF-generated drift profiles made from RNA-seq data with the profiles generated from SNP array across all 3 da- tasets ( Table S4 )., By comparing all datasets to the CCLE data- set we found that we could accurately call the same drifted/non-drifted regions in 88% and 85.2% of the genome for 90% of the overlapping samples with GDSC or gCSI, respectively (Figures S4 AS4C)., In an exemplary case of inter- and intra-insti- tutional drift between GDSC and CCLE the drift profiles inferred by RNA-seq in the HuP-T4 cell line had regions of the genome that overlapped with SNP-array estimates from GDSC (Chr4q, 6p,  7,  10p,  12q,  and 17),  regions that overlapped with CCLE (Chr3q,  4p,  8,  12p,  16p, and 21),  and regions that agreed with neither (Chr 6q,  16q,  and 20,  Figure S4 D)., Meanwhile there are cases such as VM-CUB-1 where large variance in RNA-seq es- timates of BAFs confounds a proper analysis, resulting in regions predicted to be drifted appearing as the inverse of the SNP-arrayBAF analysis ( Figure S4 E)., Such errors are expected as the noise from RNA-seq data diminishes confidence of BAF-estimated re- gions, making RNA-seq estimates less sensitive to any high ploidy or drifted regions., Overall these results suggest that ge-netic drift can be inferred from RNA-seq data and that this issue of heterogeneity is prevalent both between and within studies., Association between Genetic Drift and Drug Response As aneuploidy is a consequence of chromosomal instability, weanalyzed whether there was an association between high chro-mosomal instability and high levels of genetic drift between isogenic cell lines., Using RNA-seq from CCLE GDSC,  and gCSI datasets, we quantified chromosomal instability betweenisogenic cell lines by taking the mean expression from a set of 70 genes that are known to reflect chromosomal instability (CIN70) ( Carter et al., 2006 )., To complement this analysis we calculated the total genomic region of significantly drifted regions across all cell lines (STAR Methods)., We did not observe any correlation between the level of geneticdrift between cell lines and the CIN70 score (GDSC-CCLE, r CN_CIN = /C00.01,  r BAF_CIN = 0.01,  GNE-CCLE,  r CN_CIN = /C00.03,  rBAF_CIN = 0.01, Figures 3 A and 3D)., However we observed a large correlation between CIN70 scores and the variance of to-tal genetic drift for those cell lines (GDSC-CCLE, r CN_CIN = 0.66,  rBAF_CIN = 0.49,  GNE-CCLE,  r CN_CIN = 0.67,  r BAF_CIN = 0.53), sug- gesting that CIN70 reflects the capability of the cell lines to driftmore than the actual observed drift., We next investigated whether the discrepancy between phar- macological responses in isogenic cell lines could be attributedto genetic drift or chromosomal instability., For this analysis we considered 63 drugs found in at least 2 datasets, 20 of which are found in all three., Between two datasets and per drug we investigated (1) the correlation between the area between thedrug dose-response curves (ABC) of isogenic cell lines and the CIN70 score and (2) the correlation between the ABC of isogenic cell lines and estimates of total genomic drift (BAF or CN)., Wefound that between CCLE and GDSC the FGFR tyrosine kinaseinhibitor AZD4547 had the strongest correlation between CIN70 and ABC (p = 0.16, q value = 0.06) while other drugs such as di- nacicilib,  topotecan,  teniposide, and trametinib all showed atrend to significance between CIN70 and ABC (q < 0.25, Figures 3B and 3C)., The dual IGF-IR/insulin receptor inhibitor BMS/C0754807, showed the strongest correlation between genetic drift and ABC (p = 0.46, q value = 0.34) with a strong negative correlation between CIN70 and ABC (p = /C00.31, q value = 0.43),  however, these estimates were made using only37 samples and did not reach statistical significance., Unfortu-nately we could not test the robustness of these estimates as none of these drugs were found in the gCSI dataset., Further- more there were no significant correlations between geneticdrift or CIN70 and drug response discordance when comparing gCSI and CCLE ( Figures 3 E and 3F)., Hence our findings suggest that only a small part of the discrepancy between drug responsein cancer cell lines can be linked to either chromosomal insta- bility or genetic drift., CCLid In order to replicate our work in existing and future datasets wedeveloped the cancer cell line identification (CCLid) toolkit asboth an R package ( https, //github.com/bhklab/CCLid ) and web application (cclid.ca) to address the lack of a publicly available resource for genotype-based cell line authentication ( Korch and Varella-Garcia, 2018 )., This tool was designed to use generic VCFs generated from variant callers such as MuTect(2) ( Cibul- skis et al.,  2013 , Korch and Varella-Garcia,  2018 )., The variant calls are then overlapped with up to 507452 SNPs found across 1, 497 unique cancer cell lines from the GDSC,  CCLE,  and gCSI datasets., We minimize the memory footprint by binning thegenome into 500-kb bins and select 5 701 representativeSNPs within each region with the smallest variance to ensure a uniform and equal representation of the entire genome., We have pipelines implemented that use the resulting sample byBAF matrix for three major analyses (1) predicting cellular iden- tity,  (2) deconvolution of cross-contaminated samples, and (3) approximation of genetic drift ( Figure 4 )., While our analysis was done using 5701 SNPs, we showed that a minimum of 60 SNPs were required for accurate geno- typing ( Figure S5 ), opening up the possibility for usage in sequencing datasets, including targeted panels greater than 75 kb in size ( Zhao et al.,  2003 )., Similarly at this threshold, we were able to detect and deconvolute the overall fractionof a cross-contaminated sample in an in silico dilution series as low as a 4, 1 ratio ( Figure 4 B)., While we demonstrated that detection of cell mixtures is limited to a 41 ratio, we were able to accurately deconvolute when given prior knowledgeof which cell lines may constitute the admixed sample ( Fig- ure 4 B)., Using these tools will allow researchers to not only screen the genetic identity of their cell lines, but test for casesll Report Cell Systems 11,  393401,  October 21, 2020 397 of cross-contamination with or without prior knowledge of cell line mixtures., With the surge of transcriptomic profiling in the current litera- ture researchers can still ensure the identity or drift of their cell lines in the absence of genomic data., Not only can simple geno- type checking be done using RNA-seq data but in the pharma-cogenomic datasets used in this study,  we found that an averageof 1, 519 SNPs distributed across 500-kb bins were sufficient to estimate regions of drift in isogenic cell lines ( Figure 4 C)., We hope other researchers can benefit from these resources tonot only validate the genetic identity of their cell lines, but also to use them in longitudinal research designs to ensure genetic integrity across multiple passages and treatments.DISCUSSION Our study expands onthe106 celllineGDSC-CCLE molecular pro- file comparison work by Ben-David et al., (2018) by comparing 1 497 cell lines found across the three largest pharmacogenomic studies published to date ( Barretina et al., 2012 , Haverty et al.,  2016 , Yang et al.,  2013 )., We detected 2 out of 688 unique cell lines that existed in 2 or more datasets where the genotype was discor- dant despite synonymous cell line annotation (0.3%), significantly fewer than the expected /C2418% misidentification rate ( MacLeod et al.,  1999 )., A further analysis revealed that there were 9 out of a possible 1032 cell lines were isogenic despite all annotations de- picting these as definitively different lines (0.9%), and 11 cell lines AB C D EF Figure 3., Associations of Phenotypic Data with Measures of Genetic Drift (A and D )Plots

(Ben-David et al., 2018 ;Kleensang et al., 2016 ). Our CCLid tool expands on the genetic stability tool Cell STRAINER,  ( Ben-Da- vid et al., 2018 ) by allowing for a karyotypic comparison using discrepancies in BAF between RNA-seq and SNP array ratherthan Cell STRAINERs L2R approach, which is limited to genomicdata only., Our BAF-centric approach shows evidence of both intra- and inter-institutional genetic drift between cell lines, sug- gesting that different passages or separate stocks with distinctmolecular profiles may have been used for pharmacological profiling., These confounders especially the presence of intra- institutional drift, affects downstream pharmacogenomic ana-lyses as chromosomal instability can lead to rapid shifts in the genomic landscape across each passage ( Thompson and Compton, 2008 ), and the landscape assayed may not accurately represent the cells at the time of treatment., Our results empha-size the need for measures of genetic stability throughout an experiment and for molecular profiling to be done as close to pharmacological profiling as possible., While excellent guidelines exist for handling ( Geraghty et al. 2014 ) and authenticating cell lines ( Korch and Varella-Garcia,  2018 ), there is an absence of protocols that detect and monitor the stability of genetic profiles throughout a study., To aid in sta- bility screening we developed CCLid to allow users to compare the genomic and transcriptomic profiles of cell lines across 1, 497unique cell lines spread across 3 datasets., This extra versatility has the added benefit of being amenable to multi-omic datasets where L2R cannot be accurately estimated on certain data types(i.e., transcriptomic)., To maintain the identity and stability of thecell lines throughout a study we propose the use of stability screeners such as Cell STRAINER or CCLid in addition to, (1) Co-isolating DNA and RNA from the same sample and same day (or as close to) to limit the effects of genetic drift (2) Validating the identity of cell lines using their SNP geno- types as they are more stable than karyotype or STR and less susceptible to microsatellite instabilities ( Much et al., 2014 ) (3) Establish a baseline genetic profile and compare to the profile prior to, and following experimental manipulationto ensure maintenance of genetic identity and assess the level of genetic drift (4) Limit the number of passages as whole chromosome mis- segregation occurs once every 25 cell divisions ( Laugh- ney et al., 2015 , Lupski,  2007 , Sebat et al.,  2007 , van Om- men, 2005 ) While these practices can be implemented using any available sequencing data, they will be most reliable and sensitive with genomic data., We believe that our tool will benefit researchers to ensure the integrity of their cancer cell lines in retrospectiveand prospective research., STAR+METHODS Detailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the following, dKEY RESOURCES TABLE dRESOURCE AVAILABILITY BLead Contact BMaterials Availability BData and Code Availability dMETHOD DETAILS BPharmacogenomic Datasets BPreprocessing of Affymetrix SNP 6.0 Arrays BPreprocessing of Illumina Human Omni Arrays BPreprocessing of RNAseq data dQUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS BComparing Genotypes between Samples BCell line deconvolution BComparing Karyotypes between Samples BComparing Phenotypes SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION Supplemental Information can be found online at https, //doi.org/10.1016/j., cels.2020.08.012 .

Cell lines were linked to their Cellosaurus IDs ( Bairoch 2018 ) using functions included in CCLid that parses the cellosaurus distributed XML file (ftp, //ftp.expasy.org/databases/cellosaurus,  downloaded on February,  2020)., Preprocessing of Affymetrix SNP 6.0 Arrays Raw Affy6 files were pre-processed using the rawcopy pipeline ( Mayrhofer et al., 2016 ) implemented in the Easy Copy Number (Ea- CoN) package ( https, //github.com/gustaveroussy/EaCoN )., Analysis was conducted using the GenomeWideSNP_6 Annotations Release 35 manifest. As per Affy6 guidelines samples and datasets were removed based on poorly resolved genotype clusters and a bias toward restriction enzyme digestion during library preparation when assayed using affymetrix power tools (APT version 1.16.1) ( Affymetrix, 2008 )., The B-allele frequency (BAF) and Log 2Ratios (L2R) were exported from the EaCoN package prior to allele- specific segmentation using ASCAT version 2.5.1 (Tumor-Only mode) ( Van Loo et al., 2010 )., By modifying the EaCoN package we implemented measures to export total and allele-specific L2Rs, as well as modal copy numbers to a PharmacoGX PSet ( Smirnov et al.,  2016 , 2018 ) for all datasets analyzed., Preprocessing of Illumina Human Omni Arrays Raw Omni files were preprocessed using GenomeStudio version 2 using the HumanOmni2.5-Quad version 1.0 manifest and Hu-manOmni2.5-Quad cluster file., Genotype was called using the Genotype Module. Signal intensities were converted to log-R ratios (LRR) and B-allele frequencies (BAF) using the cnvPartition CNV Analysis Plugin version 3.2.1 The LRR and BAF were used as input into a modified version of EaCoN, which was used fed into ASCAT version 2.5.1 (Tumor-Only mode) to generate copy-num-ber profiles., Preprocessing of RNAseq data Raw FASTQ files were aligned to human genome version hg19 and transcript annotation GENCODE v19 using STAR (v 2.4.2a) two-pass method., SNPs that overlapped those found in the Affymetrix SNP6 arrays were force-called using MuTect2 and all SNPs and BAFs were strand-corrected.REAGENT or RESOURCE SOURCE IDENTIFIER Deposited DataGenomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (SNP 6.0, n=1013)(Yang et al.,  2013 ) EGAD00010000644 Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (SNP 6.0, n=1190)(Barretina et al.,  2012 ) GSE36139 Genentech Cell Line Screening Initiative (Illumina 2.5M, n=668)(Haverty et al.,  2016 ) EGAD00010000951ll Report e1Cell Systems 11,  393401.e1e2, October 21, 2020 QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Comparing Genotypes between Samples To compute the concordance between genotypes of two samples, we focused on the BAF values of 507, 452 SNPs that were found inthe SNP-array data for all three datasets used in this study., To make the SNP values from the Omni array comparable to those using Affy6 arrays we intersect based on genomic location and ensure that Ref and Alt alleles are in the same order as those in Affy6., We reduced the number of SNPs that were used for genotype concordance estimates by binning the genome into 500kb bins and se-lecting a single representative SNP from each bin based on the lowest variance., Using the resulting 5701 SNPs uniformly scatteredthroughout the genome, we did a pairwise cell line comparison to calculate the summation of Euclidean distances between the BAFs for each SNP., We then trained a logistic regression model using the given cell line annotations and under-sampling the non-matching annotation group to rectify class imbalances., Finally to measure the limit of detection using this regression approach, we selected asubset of SNPs from the 5, 701 uniformly scattered SNPs and retrained a logistic regression model for each test., Any two cell lines were considered isogenic if their predicted similarity was lower than a q-value of 0.05 (multiple testing adjusted)., This value was compared to the cell line annotations to establish a confusion matrix for precision-recall estimations., Cell line deconvolution A given cell line was deconvoluted into mixtures of cell lines using the R package NNLM (Nonnegative Linear Models) ( Lin and Bou- tros, 2020 )., A design matrix composed of SNPs by cell lines was used that incorporated prior knowledge of which cell lines composed the input sample., Non-negative matrix factorization was done on the input sample using this design matrix to estimate the relative proportion of each cell line from the design matrix in the input sample., Comparing Karyotypes between Samples To calculate concordance between copy-number profiles we used two approaches,  a BAF method and a L2R method., In the BAF approach we first reduced BAF to the 0-0.5 range and calculated the Euclidean distance between the 5, 701 uniformly scatteredSNPs., However if the input data was RNAseq, we removed all SNPs that had fewer than 5 reads supporting the SNP as this was too few to get an accurate BAF estimate., We then segmented the data using the copynumber R package ( Nilsen et al. 2012 ) imple- mentation of piecewise constant fit (pcf) with a minimum of 5 SNPs., Using all available SNPs we calculated the standard deviation ofBAF for each segmented region and used this value to draw a z-score threshold of 4 to classify a region as significantly drifted., Using a similar metric, we did the same analysis using the L2R values instead of the BAF. The ASCAT defined segments were used in lieu of SNP probeset L2R values. We calculated the pairwise Euclidean distance between all L2R-segments and median-normal-ized only if the medians of the two profiles were greater than 0.5 distance apart., This was done to mitigate the issue of two CN-profileshaving slightly different L2R values due to non-concordant median-centering in two isogenic lines., For each segment we calculated the standard deviation by taking the Euclidean distance between individual probeset L2Rs that populate that region., Finally, we used a z-score threshold of 2 to classify a region as significantly drifted. Comparing Phenotypes Reprocessed drug curves and gene expression data were accessed from the R PharmacoGx (version 1.10.3) package ( Smirnov et al., 2016 )., The recomputed areas above the curve (AAC) were used as measurements of drug sensitivity with higher AACs cor- responding to higher sensitivity ( Safikhani et al.,  2016 )., To quantify the distance between drug curves we implemented the area be- tween the curve (ABC) metric described by Safikhani and colleagues ( Safikhani et al., 2016 )., The area was estimated by taking the unsigned area between two curves intersected over overlapping concentration ranges and normalized by the length of the intersec-tion interval., Based on the cell lines RNAseq profiles we calculated the CIN70 chromosomal instability score ( Carter et al., 2006 ) following a the approach implemented by Birkbak and colleagues ( Birkbak et al., 2011 ) (CIN70 score = mean FPKM of the 70 genes that populate this geneset)., Estimates of total genomic fraction drifted and CIN70 scores were used to calculate the Pearson correlation with the ABC metrics for each drug.ll Report Cell Systems 11, 393401.e1e2,  October 21,  2020 e2,",

(2020) are as follows:\n\n1. **Genetic Identity Issues**: Less than 1.6% of the cell lines used in pharmacogenomic studies were found to have genetic identity issues, indicating a relatively high level of concordance in cell line identification across the datasets analyzed.\n\n2. **Extent of Genetic Drift**: The study revealed that a median of 4.5% to 6.1% of the total genome exhibited genetic drift between homonymous (isogenic) cell lines. This suggests that even closely related cell lines can show significant genetic variation.\n\n3. **Presence of Genetic Drift Across Datasets**: Genetic drift was observed within each dataset and between different data types, highlighting the instability of genetic profiles in cancer cell lines over time and across different assays.\n\n4. **Association with Drug Response**: There was a small association between the total genetic drift observed in cell lines and discordances in drug response. This indicates that genetic drift may contribute to variability in how cell lines respond to pharmacological treatments, although the correlation was weak.\n\n5. **Need for Guidelines**: The authors emphasize the necessity for guidelines and resources to monitor and maintain the genetic stability of cell lines throughout pharmacogenomic studies. They advocate for the use of molecular profiling to minimize the effects of genetic drift and misidentification.\n\n6. **Development of CCLid Tool**: The study introduced the CCLid web application, which allows researchers to screen the genomic profiles of their cell lines against the datasets analyzed in this study, facilitating better authentication and monitoring of genetic stability.\n\nOverall, the findings underscore the importance of genetic stability in cancer cell lines for reproducibility in pharmacogenomic research and the potential implications of genetic drift on drug response variability."

      "question": "How was the data analyzed in the study?",
      "answer": "In the study, the data analysis was conducted using several methods to assess genetic drift in cancer cell lines across three major pharmacogenomic datasets. Here are the key points regarding the data analysis:\n\n1. **Data Sources**: The analysis utilized SNP data from 1,497 unique cell lines and 63 pharmacological compounds, reprocessing 1,006 Affymetrix SNP arrays from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC), 1,213 from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), and 668 Omni 2.5 Million SNP arrays from the Genentech cell line screening initiative (gCSI).\n\n2. **Authentication of Cell Lines**: The identity of cancer cell lines was validated using 5,701 SNPs scattered across the genome. Pairwise comparisons were made between datasets (CCLE, GDSC, and gCSI) to identify isogenic cell lines and correct for misidentifications.\n\n3. **Detection of Genetic Drift**: Genetic drift was quantified by measuring karyotypic discordances using two methods:\n   - **Log-R Ratio (LRR)**: This method estimated the fraction of the genome that drifted between isogenic cell lines, revealing significant karyotypic drift in most cell lines.\n   - **B-Allele Frequency (BAF)**: This method provided a less sensitive measure of genetic drift compared to LRR. The study found that LRR was more capable of detecting abnormalities due to subclonality or heterogeneity.\n\n4. **Comparison of Drift Estimates**: The study compared drift estimates derived from LRR and BAF, finding a high concordance between the two methods despite some discrepancies in specific cases.\n\n5. **Intra- and Inter-Institutional Drift**: The analysis included comparisons of drift profiles generated from RNA-seq data with those from SNP arrays, demonstrating that genetic drift could be inferred from RNA-seq data.\n\n6. **Association with Drug Response**: The study explored the relationship between genetic drift and pharmacological response by analyzing correlations between chromosomal instability (CIN70 scores) and drug response metrics (area between drug dose-response curves).\n\n7. **Development of CCLid Toolkit**: To facilitate ongoing analysis, the authors developed the CCLid web application, which allows users to screen genomic profiles of cell lines against the datasets used in the study.\n\nOverall, the data analysis involved a combination of SNP array processing, RNA-seq data integration, statistical comparisons, and the development of tools for ongoing genetic identity verification and drift assessment."

The B-allele frequency (BAF) and Log 2 Ratios (L2R) were exported for further analysis.\n\n2. **Illumina Omni Array Preprocessing**: The raw files from the Illumina Human Omni arrays were processed using GenomeStudio, where genotype calling was performed, and signal intensities were converted to log-R ratios (LRR) and BAF. These values were then used for generating copy-number profiles.\n\n3. **RNA-seq Data Preprocessing**: The raw FASTQ files from RNA sequencing were aligned to the human genome and transcript annotations. SNPs that overlapped with those found in the SNP arrays were force-called, and all SNPs and BAFs were strand-corrected.\n\n4. **Genotype Concordance Calculation**: The study involved calculating the concordance between genotypes of two samples by focusing on BAF values of SNPs found across the datasets. This included binning the genome into 500-kb bins and selecting representative SNPs for pairwise comparisons.\n\n5. **Detection of Genetic Drift**: The study quantified genetic drift by estimating the fraction of the genome that drifted between isogenic cell lines using both LRR and BAF methods. This involved calculating the Euclidean distance between BAF values for SNPs and assessing the accuracy of drift estimates.\n\nThese preprocessing steps were crucial for ensuring the integrity and reliability of the genetic data used in the study, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of genetic drift in cancer cell lines across multiple pharmacogenomic datasets."

This approach helps to identify any biases that may arise from the use of a single data type and emphasizes the importance of using multiple data sources for validation.\n\n5. **Development of the CCLid Toolkit**: The authors created the CCLid web application to facilitate ongoing monitoring of cell line identity and genetic stability. This tool allows researchers to screen their cell lines against a comprehensive database, thereby promoting transparency and reproducibility in future studies.\n\n6. **Recommendations for Best Practices**: The paper concludes with recommendations for maintaining genetic stability throughout studies, such as co-isolating DNA and RNA, validating cell line identities using SNP genotypes, and limiting the number of passages. These practices are aimed at minimizing biases related to genetic drift and misidentification.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, the authors aim to enhance the reliability of their findings and provide a framework for addressing biases in pharmacogenomic research."

      "question": "What validation methods were used to ensure the reliability of the results?",
      "answer": "The research paper employed several validation methods to ensure the reliability of the results regarding genetic drift in large pharmacogenomic studies. Here are the key validation methods mentioned:\n\n1. **SNP Genotyping for Cell Line Authentication**: The authors used 5,701 SNPs uniformly scattered across the genome to validate the identity of cancer cell lines. Pairwise comparisons were made between datasets (CCLE, GDSC, and gCSI) to check for genotypic identity, and discrepancies were cross-referenced with the Cellosaurus database to identify misidentified or contaminated cell lines.\n\n2. **Comparison of Genetic Drift Estimates**: The study utilized two different methods to estimate genetic drift: Log-R Ratio (LRR) and B-allele Frequency (BAF). The concordance between these two methods was assessed, revealing that while they generally agreed, there were instances of significant discrepancies that highlighted the sensitivity of LRR to subclonality and heterogeneity.\n\n3. **Cross-Validation Across Datasets**: The analysis involved comparing genetic drift estimates across different datasets (GDSC, CCLE, and gCSI) to ensure consistency in findings. This included assessing intra- and inter-institutional genetic drift and confirming that similar levels of genetic drift were observed across different platforms.\n\n4. **Statistical Analysis of Drug Response Correlation**: The authors analyzed the association between genetic drift and pharmacological response by calculating correlations between genetic drift measures (BAF and CN) and drug response metrics (area between drug dose-response curves). This statistical analysis helped validate the impact of genetic drift on drug response variability.\n\n5. **Development of the CCLid Toolkit**: The authors created the CCLid web application to allow users to screen genomic profiles of their cell lines against the datasets analyzed. This tool was designed to facilitate ongoing validation of cell line identity and genetic stability, providing a resource for researchers to monitor genetic integrity throughout their studies.\n\n6. **Use of RNA-seq Data**: The study leveraged RNA-seq data alongside SNP array data to enhance the detection of genetic drift, demonstrating that RNA-seq can be used to infer genetic stability and identity, thus providing a complementary approach to traditional SNP analysis.\n\nThese methods collectively contributed to the robustness of the findings regarding genetic drift in cancer cell lines used in pharmacogenomic studies, emphasizing the importance of molecular profiling and genetic stability monitoring in biomedical research."

      "question": "Are there any contradictions between this paper's findings and previous research?",
      "answer": "Based on the content of the research paper, there are indeed some contradictions between the findings of this study and previous research. \n\n1. **Extent of Genetic Drift**: The paper reports that a median of 4.5% to 6.1% of the total genome is drifted between homonymous cell lines, which is significantly lower than the estimates provided by Ben-David et al. (2018). In their study, Ben-David et al. reported an estimated 19% discordance in non-silent mutations and 26% discordance in copy-number variants (CNVs) between cell lines shared between the Broad Institute and the Sanger Institute. The current study's findings suggest that the genetic drift is less severe than previously thought, which contradicts the higher rates of discordance reported by Ben-David et al.\n\n2. **Misidentification Rates**: The current study found only 0.3% of cell lines to be misidentified or problematic, which is significantly lower than the expected misidentification rate of 24% reported by MacLeod et al. (1999). This discrepancy indicates that the current study presents a more optimistic view of cell line integrity compared to earlier findings.\n\n3. **Association with Drug Response**: The paper indicates a small association between genetic drift and drug response discordance, suggesting that only a small part of the discrepancy in drug responses can be attributed to genetic drift or chromosomal instability. This contrasts with previous studies that have implied a stronger link between genetic instability and variability in drug response, such as the work by Ben-David et al. and Kleensang et al., which highlighted significant functional consequences of genetic drift on drug responses.\n\nIn summary, the findings of this paper suggest lower rates of genetic drift and misidentification compared to previous studies, as well as a weaker association between genetic drift and drug response variability, indicating contradictions with earlier research in these areas."
