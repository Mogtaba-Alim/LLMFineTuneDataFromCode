Gene-wise comparison of microarray and RNA-Seq data revealed that 52% had a Spearman s correlation coefficient greater than 0.7 with highly correlated genes displaying significantly higher expression levels., We found excellent correlation between microarray and RNA-Seq for the estrogen receptor (ER r s= 0.973,  95% CI,  0.971-0.975),  progesterone receptor (PgR,  r s=0 ., 9 5  0.947-0.954),  and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2,  r s= 0.918,  0.912-0.923), while a few discordances between ER and PgR quantified by immunohistochemistry and RNA-Seq/microarray were observed., All the subtype classifiers evaluated agreed well (Cohen s kappa coefficients >0.8) and all the proliferation-based GES showed excellent Spearman correlations between microarray and RNA-Seq (all r s>0.965)., Immune- stroma- and pathway-based GES showed a lower correlation relative to prognostic signatures (all r s>0.6)., Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study to report a systematic comparison of RNA-Seq to microarray for the evaluation of single genes and GES clinically relevant to BC., According to our results the vast majority of single gene biomarkers and well-established GES can be reliably evaluated using the RNA-Seq technology., Keywords Breast cancer,  Gene expression signatures,  Affymetrix,  Microarray,  Illumina,  RNA-Seq, Immunohistochemistry,  Estrogen receptor,  Progesterone receptor,  HER2 receptor * Correspondence, christos.sotiriou@bordet.be , bhaibeka@uhnresearch.ca Equal contributors 1Breast Cancer Translational Research Laboratory (BCTL), Institut Jules Bordet,  Brussels,  Belgium 8Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network,  Toronto,  ON, Canada Full list of author information is available at the end of the article  2014 Fumagalli et al., ; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Multiple expression-based classifiers have been developed including two versions of the Subtype Classification Model (SCM) (SCMOD1 [7]and SCMOD2 [8]), and the simple three-gene model (SCMGENE [9]) developed by Sotiriou and co-workers, as well as three variants of the Single Sample Predictor (SSP)(SSP2003 [10], SSP2006 [11] and PAM50 [12]) developed by Perou and co-workers, the latter having been recently translated into a clinical assay (Prosigna TM[13])., The com- putational implementation and comparison of these clas- sifiers has been documented in [9]. Microarrays have also been used to derive a series of gene expression signaturesaimed at characterizing the biology of the disease and at helping clinicians predict relapse and response to treatment more accurately than tools using traditionalclinico-pathological parameters [7, 12, 14-27]., Some of these signatures have been endorsed by international breast cancer guidelines and they are being increasingly imple-mented in standard practice [6]., In parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is emerging as the technology of reference for thorough characterization of the human transcriptome and as a superior alternative to microarrays to define gene expression levels [28-31].RNA-Seq is overcoming some of the drawbacks of micro- arrays [28-32]., For instance the dependence of microar- rays on hybridization of transcripts to pre-determinedprobes restricts analysis to genes for which genomic se- quence information is available first-hand and to se- quences that are distant enough so that probes do notcross-hybridize., Moreover high levels of background noise arising from non-specific hybridization and probe sat- uration affect the quantificatio n of transcripts expressed at low and high levels, respectively,  limiting the dynamicrange of the technology., Although the RNA-Seq technology efficiently address these issues the current lack of standards for analyzing these new data, coupled with the relativelyhigh cost of the RNA-Seq experiments, could deter investi- gators from implementing the technology in their activity., Several studies have been carried out to compare the performance of RNA-Seq and microarrays including exon arrays,  in defining levels of gene expression [33-42]., The vast majority of them have focused on es-tablishing the reliability of RNA-Seq in differential gene expression (DGE) analyses between two or more sam- ples and/or conditions of interest., Despite the fact thatthey have generally reported good correlation between the two technologies most of these studies have relied on relatively few samples or exclusively on non-humansamples., Moreover they have never attempted to assess the performance of RNA-Seq in defining clinically rele- vant biomarkers developed using microarrays., Giventhe promise of microarray-based gene signatures [43] and the significant advantages of the new RNA-Seq technology in providing more accurate and reliablegene expression measurements, there is a dire need to investigate the transition of breast cancer gene signa- tures from microarray to RNA-Seq., The main aim of the current study is to compare the agreement between two of the most widely used micro- array and RNA-Seq platforms, Affymetrix and IlluminaHiSeq respectively, in estimating (1) the expression of single genes which are clinically relevant to breast can- cer and (2) breast cancer subtype classifiers and gene ex-pression signatures that have been developed over the years with microarrays., The comparison uses a dataset obtained from well characterized breast cancer patientsrepresenting the four main breast cancer subtypes, triple negative,  HER2 positive,  luminal A,  and luminal B., Methods Sample selection and characterization Fresh-frozen tumor material was obtained from 57 breast cancer patients who were treated at Institut Jules Bordet (Brussels, Belgium) between 2007 and 2011 and whose samples were stored at the institute s biorepository., The samples represented the four main known breast cancer subtypes (by IHC) and their tumor cell content evaluated on a hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) slide by a board-certifiedbreast cancer pathologist was greater than or equal to 30%., Of the 57 patients 17 had triple negative breast can- cer (TN,  ER,  PgR,  and HER2 negative), 14 HER2 positive(any ER and PgR,  HER2 positive),  16 luminal A (ER,  HER2 negative, histological grade 1),  and 10 luminal B (ER,  HER2 negative,  histological grade 3)., The use of thetumor material is consistent with the informed consent signed by the patients and was granted approval by Insti- tut Jules Bordet s ethics committee (approval number, Fumagalli et al., BMC Genomics 2014 15, 1008 Page 2 of 12 http, //www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/15/1008 CE1967), and is in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations in Belgium., RNA extraction RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Life Technologies Carlsbad, California) following the manufacturer s instruc- tions., Concentration was measured using the NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific Waltham,  Massachusetts), and integrity (RIN, RNA Integrity Number) was assessed usingan Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,  California)., All the samples yielded enough material for downstream experiments and had a RIN equal to orgreater than 6.5., RNA obtained from the same extraction procedure was profiled on microarrays and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000., Microarray experiments 100 ng of total RNA was profiled at the Institut JulesBordet using the Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara,  Calif ornia),  following the manu- facturer s instructions., Briefly, the RNA was first reverse- transcribed into double-stranded cDNA. This cDNA was transcribed in vitro. After purification of the aRNA 12.5 g were fragmented and labeled prior to hybridization to thechips., Quality control (QC) for each chip was performed following the recommendations posted on [44]. Following QC the probe level intensities were background ad-justed and quantile normalized using the Frozen Robust Multiarray Analysis (fRMA) method [45] as implemented in the R/Bioconductor package fmra [46]., Probeset levelannotations were obtained from R/Bioconductor package jetset [47] and complemented with BioMart [48], when multiple probesets mapped to the same Entrez Gene ID, the probeset with the highest jetset score was selected., The raw Affymetrix CEL files are available from the NCBI s Gene Expression Omnibus under accession num- ber GSE43358., The data can be accessed through this link http, // www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=trmzbecoaqyugtc&acc=GSE43358., RNA-Seq sample preparation and sequencing Transcriptome sequencing was performed at DNAVision (Gosselies, Belgium)., Transcriptome libraries were con- structed using the Illumina  TruSeq TMRNA Sample Preparation Kit for paired-end reads sequencing on the HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, San Diego,  California) following the manufacturer s instructions., Briefly starting from 1g of total RNA, the poly-A containing mRNA mole- cules were purified using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads., Following purification the mRNA was fragmen-ted into small pieces using divalent cations under ele- vated temperature., The cleaved RNA fragments were copied into first strand cDNA using reverse transcriptaseand random primers., This was followed by second strand cDNA synthesis using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H and purification using the AMPure XP beads (AgencourtBioSciences Corporation, Beverly,  Massachusetts)., The cDNA fragments were end repaired with the addition of as i n g l e Abase and the ligation of adapters., The prod- ucts were purified using the AMPure XP beads and enriched with PCR (15 cycles) to create the final cDNA library followed by purification using the AMPure XPbeads., Library quality control and quantification were performed using the Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 and qRT- PCR., The libraries were then pooled (4 libraries/pool).Clusters were generated in a cBot Cluster Generation System using the Paired-End Cluster Generation Kit v2- HS and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 plat-form with a 2x50 base-pairs paired-end mode., Base calls were made using the Illumina CASAVA 1.5 pipeline. Se- quence data has been deposited at the EuropeanGenome-phenome Archive (EGA) which is hosted by the EBI and the CRG [49], under study s accession num- ber EGAS00001000495 and dataset s accession number EGAD00001000626., Assessment of RNA-Seq data quality The following statistics were computed to verify thequality of the RNA-Seq data (Additional file 1, Table S1)., The total number of paired reads the average Phred qual- ity scores, and the average GC content were calculated onthe quality trimmed FASTQ files with FastQC [50]., The percentage of proper pairs defined as mapped paired reads with an insert size ranging from 60 to 160 bp, wascalculated with BamTools [51]., The percentage of aligned duplicate read pairs was calculated with Picard tools MarkDuplicates [52]. RNA-Seq analysis After trimming the poor quality bases the reads were mapped to the human reference genome hg19 with TopHat2 (version 2.0.0) [53], and gene expression wasquantified with Cufflinks (version 2.0.0) [53]., The anno- tation file (GTF file) used for both alignment and gene quantification was downloaded from Ensembl (on 26July, 2012)., To match the log scale of gene expression measurements from the microarray data the FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Millionmapped reads) values computed by Cufflinks were log- transformed using the following formula, X14log2 X1 where X represents the FPKM value computed by Cufflinks, and X is the log-transformed expression value.Fumagalli et al., BMC Genomics 2014 15, 1008 Page 3 of 12 http, //www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/15/1008 Gene expression signatures Our study focused on the following gene expression signatures, (1) six prognostic signatures (GENE70 [14], GENE21 [15],  Genomic Grade Index (GGI [16]), Risk of Relapse-Score (ROR-S [12]),  ENDOPREDICT [17],  and CIN70 [18]), (2) two immune signatures (STAT1-MODULE [7] and IRMODULE [1 9]), (3) three stroma- related signatures (PLAUMODULE [7],  DCN [20],  and STROMACD10 [21]), and (4) ten pathway related sig-natures (PIK3CA-GS [22],  PTEN loss [23],  IGF1 [24], AKT/mTOR [25],  MAPK [26],  SRC,  RAS,  MYC,  E2F3,  and beta-catenin [27])., We also evaluated six subtypeclassifiers SCMOD1 [7],  SCMOD2 [8],  SCMGENE [9],  SSP2003 [10], SSP2006 [11],  and PAM50 [12]., In addition to these multivariate subtyping models we evaluated thethree individual breast cancer clinically relevant genes,  ER,  PgR,  and HER2., We used the original signature algorithms for GENE70 GENE21,  GGI,  ROR-S,  ENDOPREDICT,  CIN70, STAT1- MODULE,  PLAUMODULE, DCN and STROMACD10 as implemented in the Bioconductor package genefu [54]., For the remaining gene expression signatures we com- puted the signature scores following the approach used in Ignatiadis et al., [55]. The scores were computed from thelist of genes in their respective signatures (as listed in GeneSigDB [56]) as the weighted average using the follow- ing formula, s14 X inwixi X inwijj where sis the signature score, nis the number of genes in the signature of interest,  xiis the expression of the gene, and the gene-specific weight wi{1, 1} is the sign of the coefficient defined in the original publica- tion., Only genes that could be mapped to EntrezGene IDs were used. Finally each signature score wasrescaled so that the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles were equal to +1 and 1 respectively., Data analysis The pair-wise correlation between Affymetrix microar- rays and Illumina RNA-Seq gene expression data andgene expression signatures scores was assessed using Spearman s rank-based correlation., For the three single gene biomarkers (ER PgR and HER2), the correlationbetween microarray or RNA-Seq with IHC was esti- mated to identify which technology provided better concordance with IHC., Cohen s kappa coefficient was used to compare the subtype classifications from microarray or RNA-Seq data., To statistically compare the Spearman cor- relation and Cohen s kappa coefficients of different genesignatures, we used a two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test with 100 bootstrap replicates of the 57 patients to deter- mine the p-value., The resulting p-values reporting the sig-nificance of the correlation difference between each pair of gene expression signatures, were corrected for multiple testing using Bonferroni sm e t h o d ., To compare the correlation of gene expression over the whole transcriptome between each pair of data type from a given sample, we used Spearman s rank-based correlation, the null distribution of which was estab- lished as the range of coefficients observed from all pos- sible combinations of the 57 pairs excluding self-selfpairs., This is efficiently computed from the cross correl- ation matrix minus the diagonal elements. The analyses performed in this study are fully reproducible and com-ply with proposed guidelines in terms of availability of the code and data [57]., The R scripts developed for the analysis are available upon request. Data availability The raw Affymetrix CEL files are available from theNCBI s Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE43358., The data can be accessed through this link http, //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=trmzbecoaqyugtc&acc=GSE43358., Sequence data has been deposited at the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) which is hosted bythe EBI and the CRG [49], under study s accession num- ber EGAS00001000495 and dataset s accession number EGAD00001000626., Results Gene-wise comparison of expression levels using Affymetrix microarray and Illumina RNA-Seq platforms A subset of 16, 097 genes were defined as common to the two platforms and retained for downstream analysis.Gene identifiers did not perfectly overlap due to differ- ences in the annotation systems, jetset matched the Affymetrix probesets to the NCBI RefSeq human cDNAdatabase, while the RNA-Seq analysis pipeline used Ensembl gene annotations (see Methods for more de- tail)., When comparing the expression levels of the genesretained after selection of the best Affymetrix probeset, we found that although the scale of expression values differs due to different technology and normalizationprocedures, their rank is well conserved with 52%,  34%, and 11% of these genes having Spearman s rank-based correlation greater than 0.7,  0.8,  and 0.9, respectively(Figure 1A)., The Spearman correlation coefficient for each evaluated gene is reported in Additional file 1 Table S2., We observed that genes with the highest correlation coefficients for the comparison of microarray and RNA- Seq were significantly more expressed., Similarly, theFumagalli et al. BMC Genomics 2014 15, 1008 Page 4 of 12 http, //www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/15/1008 genes that were positively correlated were significantly more expressed than genes that were negatively correlated (two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test p-value <1x1016, Additional file 2,  Figure S1)., This result holds true when considering a high cutoff of correlation r s0.7 (two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test p-value <1x1016, F i g u r e1 B and 1C)., This phenomenon could be explained by the potentially higher variance of genes expressed at low levels [58] or by the fact that microarrays have a limited dynamic range compared to RNA-Seq [28-32]., In order to investigate this phenomenon more deeply we computed the correlation for genes with cumulative increasing expr ession (Additional file 3, Figure S2)., By starting with genes expressed at low levels and increasing gene expression levels by incre- m e n t so f1 % , w eo b s e r v e das t e e pr i s ei nt h em e d i a n correlation coefficient,  i n contrast, the magnitude of the decrease moving away from genes expressed at high levels was much lower., These results suggest that despite the potential saturation of microarrays for highly expressed genes, the correlation between the two technologies remains high,  however, we observed a high-level of inconsistency for genes expressed at low levels, either originating from microarray or RNA- seq technology,  or both., We acknowledge from past experience with gene ex- pression microarrays that when comparing the whole transcriptome, two unrelated samples may have a cor- relation coefficient that is as high as two arrays per- formed on the same sample, raising questions about the significance of an asymptotic p-value in that particular setting., In our dataset the correlation of gene expres- sion profiles for the whole transcriptome measured bymicroarray and RNA-Seq was statistically significant for all except three patients (Additional file 4, Figure S3)., Definition of ER PgR,  and HER2 status according to IHC,  microarray, and RNA-Seq Among the genes retained for analysis, we focused our attention on three that are clinically relevant for breast cancer,  ER,  PgR, and HER2., Measuring them precisely is of utmost importance to clinical practice as these are presently the only validated breast cancer predictive bio- markers available, and they are routinely used to make decisions about patient treatment [6, 59]., When comparing the expression levels of these three genes as defined by microarray and RNA-Seq we found excellent Spearman correlation coefficients,  0.973 for ER [95% CI,  0.971-0.975], 0.95 for PgR [95% CI,  0.947-0.954],  and 0.918 for HER2 [95% CI,  0.912-0.923] (Figure 2)., We then went a step further and compared the gene ex- pression levels defined by either RNA-Seq or Affymetrix with IHC, which is currently considered to be the method- ology of reference for the definition of these markers, together with FISH for HER2 [60, 61]., Overall a good cor- relation was found between the technologies (r s>0.69), and only a few discordances were observed (Additional file 5,  Figure S4)., Correlation between technologies for the definition of breast cancer subtype classifiers Two different gene expression approaches have been developed to prospectively classify breast cancers into molecular subtypes, Subtype Classification Models (SCMs) [7-9] and Single Sample Predictors (SSPs) [10-12], which include PAM50., In the current dataset Affymetrix microarray 4681012 Wilcoxon rank sum test pvalue =

highest correlation between microarray and RNA-Seq technolo-gies ( = 0.975, Figure 3A,  Additional file 1,  Table S3), which was significantly higher than the other classifiers (100 bootstrap replicates, corrected p-value <0.001, Additional file 1,  Table S4)., Of note although the kappa coefficients for SCMGENE [9] and PAM50 [12] were very similar ( = 0.903 vs. 0.902 for SCMGENE and PAM50, respectively),  SCMGENE was more concordant than PAM50 in our study (corrected p-value = 0.001, Additionalfile 1,  Table S4)., Correlation between technologies gene prognostic signatures Using

Signature enrichment in highly expressed genes and correlation between technologies Since higher correlation coefficients were found for genes expressed at higher levels, we investigated whether enrich- ment in genes with higher expression in the above subtypeclassifiers and gene expression signatures could have af- fected their correlation when defined with the two tech- nologies., We found that 81% (22/27) and 74% (20/27) ofthe signatures were significantly enriched with highly Figure 4 Risk prediction scores of the commercially available prognostic signatures., Scatterplots reporting the continuous risk prediction scores of the commercially available prognostic signatures., Each dot is colored according to the corresponding risk classification blue for concordant l ow-risk,  orange for concordant intermediate risk, green for concordant high-risk and red for discordance., The cutoff used to discretize the continuous risk predictions into risk classifications are represented in dashed red lines., Spearman correlation coefficient and p-value are provided below the plots.Fumagalli et al.

In breast cancer international guidelines endorsethe implementation of microarray-derived gene signa- tures to support clinicians in the treatment decision- making process [6]., In addition the upcoming resultsof two genome-forward clinical trials, namely the MIND- ACT and the TailorX trials [62, 63],  involving thousands of patients, will provide the highest level of evidence to dateabout whether basing clinical decisions on microarray- derived prognostic gene signatures influences the outcome of breast cancer patients., The parallel rise of RNA-Seq asan accurate and reliable alternative to microarrays for transcriptome characterization and gene expression quan- tification is puzzling for investigators, who must decidewhich technology best fulfills their clinical needs., Hence it is imperative to determine the reliability of transitioning from microarray to sequenci ng platforms in the clinical setting., To our knowledge our is the first report inves- tigating the correlation between the expression level of single clinically relevant genes and gene expression sig-natures obtained with the most commonly used micro- array and RNA-Seq platforms, Affymetrix and Illumina respectively,  in a selected dataset of breast cancer patients., When focusing on the genes in common between the two platforms our analysis showed that the expression of more than half of them had a Spearman correlation of0.7., This was the case simply by selecting the most spe- cific Affymetrix probeset and correlating it to gene log2 transformed FPKM obtained at sequencing, without anyfurther computation., In studies exploring the correlation of the two technologies in defining genes differentially expressed among samples and/or conditions, the correl-ation values of fold change ratios were reported to range from 0.55 to 0.85 [33-42]., Of note these values are simi- lar to or higher than the correlation observed across dif-ferent microarray platforms [64]., In these same studies RNA-Seq seemed to be more reliable than microarray in identifying differential gene expression, in several re-ports, a large proportion of genes identified as differen- tially expressed by RNA-Seq but not by microarray were in fact confirmed by qPCR [33, 34, 65]., RNA-Seq alsoseems more suitable than microarrays to quantify abso- lute gene expression levels when compared with mass spectrometry measurements [35].As reported by other investigators [28, 35, 65], we found that the correlation of genes was higher when their ex- pression levels were higher., The reliance of microarrayson the presence of primers and probes limits their ability to measure extreme gene expressions, according to our data,  the limitation seems to be more relevant in the lowexpression range., On the contrary the nature of sequen- cing technologies allows the unbiased investigation of gene expression when enough depth is assured., In our study RNA-Seq showed high correlation with microarrays when measuring clinically relevant genes in breast cancer (i.e., ER,  PgR,  and HER2)., Nevertheless des-pite an overall good correlation, both technologies showed a few discordances when compared to IHC., Similar results have already been reported when comparing microarraywith IHC [66,67]. These discordances might be partly at- tributed to the fact that IHC measures the expression of ER PgR,  and HER2 at the protein level, while both Affy-metrix and RNA-Seq measure the expression levels of the corresponding mRNAs., Although mRNA and protein ex- pression levels are not fully independent one cannot ex-clude that post-transcriptional regulation might affect their correlation., Another factor that could account for these discordances is tumor heterogeneity. The expressionlevels of the three markers can in fact vary across different areas of the tumor. While the RNA profiled on microarray and sequenced on the Illumina platform was obtainedfrom the same tumor area, the slides used for IHC stain- ing were cut from a distinct area of the tumor lesion., The best way to capture the activity level of these receptorsand their downstream pathways remains largely unclear., It is possible that the determination of ER PgR, and HER2 status at the mRNA level could provide clinicians with amore reproducible,  quantitative, and informative assess- ment of these markers [68, 69]., For the time being how- ever, not enough evidence is available to recommendmRNA-based measurements for clinical practice., Because of the clinical relevance of breast cancer sub- types much attention has been paid to the performanceof microarray-derived subtype classifiers., Some con- cerns have been raised about their reliability though. It has been shown that although every SSP can consist- ently identify molecular subtypes with different levels of survival, they do not reliably assign the same patientsto the same molecular subtype [70]., Variation in gene expression data and classification algorithms could in- fluence how samples are classified into each subtype., Inour study the best correlation between microarray and RNA-Seq was obtained for SCMOD2 [8], one of the subtype classifiers developed by our group., Similar cor-relation coefficients were obtained for PAM50 [12] and SCMGENE [9] with the latter showing slightly higher concordance., This result suggests the higher robustnessof SCMGENE to small perturbations which concursFumagalli et al., BMC Genomics 2014 15, 1008 Page 8 of 12 http, //www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/15/1008 with our recent robustness study [9]., However it is un- likely that ProsignaTM, the recent clinical assay imple- menting PAM50 using the NanoString platform, wouldsuffer the same limitation since its analytical validity has been thoroughly assessed [13]., Given the increasing implementation of microarray- derived gene signatures in clinical practice it is vital to determine if RNA-Seq could reliably be used to define them., When considering 21 of the most relevant signa-tures developed in recent years [712, 14-27], we found that the correlation values for microarray and RNA-Seq for signature determination ranged from moderate tovery strong., Correlation values were higher for prognos- tic signatures than biological signatures independently from their enrichment in highly expressed genes., Thissuggests that proliferation which drives prognostic sig- natures, is more robust and reproducible than signals coming from other biological processes and that com-plex signatures developed on microarrays might be less stable., Conclusions In our study we have demonstrated that RNA-Seq canreliably be used to evaluate both the expression of clin- ically relevant single genes and well established geneexpression signatures origin ally defined with microarray technology., Considering the advantages that RNA-Seq offers over microarray such as its ability to explore lar-ger sets of genes, it is envisaged that its application to wider datasets could even provide information relevant for de-novo classification of breast cancer or for the de-velopment of new prognostic and predictive signatures., With the cost of RNA-Seq experiments decreasing con- tinuously and with well-established analytical tools in-creasingly available [71-75], RNA-Seq is becoming an accessible tool that is superseding microarray in the re- search setting., We foresee that with the aid of initia-tives such as the SEquencing Quality Control (SEQC) consortium (the third phase of the FDA-led MAQC project) [76] and studies such as ours confirming its re-liability, RNA-Seq will eventually also supersede micro- arrays in the clinical setting., Additional files Additional file 1: Table S1.

The samples represented the four main molecular subtypes of breast cancer (triple negative, HER2 positive, luminal A, and luminal B). A board-certified pathologist evaluated the tumor cell content, ensuring it was greater than or equal to 30%.\n\n2. **RNA Extraction**: RNA was extracted from the tumor samples using TRIzol, following the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration and integrity of the RNA were assessed using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and an Agilent Bioanalyzer, respectively.\n\n3. **Microarray Experiments**: The RNA samples (100 ng) were profiled using Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays. The process included reverse transcription of RNA into cDNA, in vitro transcription, fragmentation, labeling, and hybridization to the microarray chips. Quality control was performed, and the data were background adjusted and quantile normalized using the Frozen Robust Multiarray Analysis (fRMA) method.\n\n4. **RNA-Seq Sample Preparation and Sequencing**: For RNA-Seq, transcriptome libraries were constructed from 1 \u00b5g of total RNA using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit. The mRNA was purified, fragmented, reverse transcribed, and amplified through PCR. The libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.\n\n5. **RNA-Seq Data Quality Assessment**: Quality metrics such as the total number of paired reads, average Phred quality scores, and GC content were calculated. The percentage of proper pairs and aligned duplicate read pairs were also assessed.\n\n6. **RNA-Seq Data Analysis**: The RNA-Seq reads were mapped to the human reference genome (hg19) using TopHat2, and gene expression was quantified with Cufflinks.

It specifically focuses on the expression of individual genes and gene expression signatures (GES) derived from microarray data.\n\n2. **High Correlation in Gene Expression**: Among the 16,097 genes common to both platforms, 52% showed a Spearman correlation coefficient greater than 0.7. Notably, genes with higher expression levels exhibited significantly higher correlation between the two technologies.\n\n3. **Clinically Relevant Genes**: The study found excellent correlation for key breast cancer biomarkers: estrogen receptor (ER) with a correlation coefficient of 0.973, progesterone receptor (PgR) at 0.947, and HER2 at 0.918. However, some discrepancies were noted between RNA-Seq/microarray results and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assessments.\n\n4. **Subtype Classifiers**: The subtype classifiers evaluated (including SCMOD2 and PAM50) showed high agreement between the two technologies, with Cohen's kappa coefficients exceeding 0.8, indicating strong concordance.\n\n5. **Gene Expression Signatures**: The correlation for proliferation-based GES was particularly strong (all r > 0.965), while immune-stroma and pathway-based signatures showed lower correlations (all r > 0.6). This suggests that proliferation signals are more robust and reproducible compared to other biological processes.\n\n6. **Reliability of RNA-Seq**: The findings support the reliability of RNA-Seq for evaluating both single gene biomarkers and established GES originally defined using microarray technology. The authors suggest that RNA-Seq could serve as a superior alternative to microarrays in clinical settings due to its advantages in measuring gene expression levels.\n\n7. **Implications for Clinical Practice**: The study highlights the potential for RNA-Seq to replace microarrays in clinical applications, particularly as costs decrease and analytical tools become more accessible. This transition could enhance the accuracy of breast cancer classification and prognosis.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper establishes that RNA-Seq is a reliable method for assessing clinically relevant gene expression in breast cancer, with strong correlations to established microarray data, thereby supporting its use in clinical practice."
