Frontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org 01TYPE Original Research PUBLISHED 04 January 2023 DOI10.3389/fgene.2022.1027345 1 Introduction Patient response to anticancer drugs varies widely, and the genomic-make-up of a patient s tumor is a major factor contributing to this variation., The filed of pharmacogenomics studies the in fluence of genomic variation on individualized drug response ( Iorio et al., 2016 )., Due to the limited access and high cost of clinical samples cancer cell lines are frequently used to investigate disease biology and its relationship to drug response for biomarker discovery ( Basu et al., 2013 , Iorio et al.,  2016 )., Due to the complexity of generating pharmacogenomic datasets the reproducibility of preclinical data and the findings from high-throughput pro filing studies in cancer cell lines has been extensively investigated ( Haibe-Kains et al., 2013 ,  Haverty et al.,  2016 , Safikhani et al.,  2016 )., Technological improvements in high-throughput drug screening enable thegeneration of large-scale pharmacogenomic datasets, which provide a remarkable opportunity for the identi fication of biomarkers predictive of drug response., However, biomarkersoften fail to generalize across independent studies. This is due to the complexity of biological systems the use of different experimental protocols, and the application of various technology platforms for both molecular pro filing and data processing methods ( Haibe-Kains et al., 2013 , Haverty et al.,  2016 , Dempster et al.,  2019 )., Moreover the large number of features and relatively small number of cell lines can lead to findings that are not generalizable and show bias when assessed in independent cohorts ( Tseng et al., 2012 , Hatzis et al.,  2014 ,  Sweeney et al.,  2017 )., To address these issues meta-analyses can be performed to integrate independent studies to identify more reliable biomarkers by increasing statistical power and reducing false positives ( Sweeney et al., 2017 , Abbas-Aghababazadeh et al.,  2020 , Borenstein et al.,  2021 )., In recent years several meta- analysis methods have been proposed such as combining p-values ( Fisher et al., 1934 , Stouffer et al.,  1949 , Won et al.,  2009 ), combining effect estimates ( Borenstein et al.,  2021 ),  and rankings ( Hong et al.,  2006 )., The strengths and limitations of meta-analyses are evaluated particularly with respect to theirability to assess variation across studies or heterogeneity (e.g., platform variability,  inconsistent annotation,  various methods for data processing, cell lines heterogeneity,  and laboratory-specific effects) beyond within-study variation (e.g., experimental designs and populations of interest) ( Veroniki et al.,  2016 )., As a result the selection of an optimal meta- analysis method depends considerably on the available data structure and the hypothesis setting to achieve the underlying biological goal ( Chang et al., 2013 )., Combining the p-values from multiple independent studies has the bene fit of simplicity and extensibility to different kinds of outcome variables ( Tseng et al., 2012 , Chang et al.,  2013 )., However this can only be performed under the parametric assumption where the p-values are uniformly distributedunder the null hypothesis, while not accounting for the data heterogeneity and direction of effect sizes, which represents a major limitation of this method ( Marot et al.,  2009 )., Approaches that combine effects including fixed- and random-effects (FE & RE) models are widely used to achieve a broad inferential basis for evaluations of effects ( Cochran, 1954 , Borenstein et al.,  2021 )., Under the FE model we assume that there is one true effect thatunderlies all the studies in the analysis, and that all differences in observed effects are due to sampling error., In contrast the RE model incorporates the variability of the effects across studies inaddition to the within-study variability using a two-stage hierarchical process., Several approaches have been proposed to combine individual study results into an overall estimate ofeffect using the inverse-variance strategy ( Egger et al., 2008 )., Assessing heterogeneity is a critical issue in meta-analysis because different models may lead to different estimates ofoverall effect and different standard errors., Several approaches have been suggested that vary in popularity and complexity for how best to carry out such combinations ( Veroniki et al., 2016 ,  Guolo and Varin,  2017 , Langan et al.,  2019 )., Cochran ( Cochran 1954 ) proposed a Qtest to determine the heterogeneity across studies, however its statistical power depends on the number of studies and sample size ( Whitehead and Whitehead, 1991 ,  Turner et al.,  2012 , Hoaglin,  2016 , Bodnar et al.,  2017 )., Higgins and Thompson proposed better statistic I 2to describe heterogeneity that re flects the proportion of total variance that is attributed to heterogeneity ( Higgins et al., 2003 )., Meta-analysis allows us to quantify heterogeneity between studies but precisely estimating the between-study heterogeneity is challenging., This is especially true if the number of studies included is small. ABayesian approach was proposed to capture the uncertainty in the estimation of the between-study variance by incorporating prior knowledge ( Sutton and Abrams, 2001 , Bodnar et al.,  2017 ,  Rover,  2017 )., Traditional meta-analysis procedures make a crucial assumption: effects are independent. When this assumption isviolated conclusions based on meta-analyses can be misleading and will bias the overall effect estimate along with in flating Type I error., In real-world applications there are various sources ofeffect dependencies within and across studies., For instance a meta-analysis uses more than one outcome measure for the same sample of participants, two treatment groups with the samecontrol group,  duplicate full or partial data or samples, and effects reported by the same research group ( Becker,  2000 , Wood,  2008 , Lin and Sullivan, 2009 , Hedges et al.,  2010 , Cheung,  2014 ,  Scammacca et al.,  2014 , Van den Noortgate et al., 2015 , Cheung,  2019 , Cooper et al.,  2019 , Liu et al.,  2019 , Wilson,  2019 , Liu and Xie, 2020 , Luo et al.,  2020 , Borenstein et al.,  2021 )., The dependence of the effects must be resolved in a way that permits each study to contribute a single independent effect to the meta-analysis or modeled dependence in order to avoidthreats to the validity of the meta-analysis results., Re flecting on duplicate data problems detecting potential duplicate studies Frontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org 02Abbas-Aghababazadeh et al., 10.3389/fgene.2022.1027345 and options for the correction of duplication were discussed while the issue of prevention of duplication has not yet been addressed ( Wood,  2008 )., In general different strategies have been proposed to handle dependency including ignoringdependence, avoiding dependence [e.g.,  averaging effects (Wood, 2008 ) or shifting unit-of-analysis ( Cooper et al.,  2019 )],  modeling dependence [e.g., robust variance estimation (Hedges et al.,  2010 ),  multivariate meta-analysis ( Becker,  2000 ), multilevel meta-analysis ( Cheung,  2014 , Van den Noortgate et al.,  2015 , Cheung,  2019 )], and determining the covariance of effects across studies for overlap samples ( Lin and Sullivan, 2009 , Luo et al.,  2020 )., Moreover, the Cauchy combination test Liu et al. (2019) Liu and Xie (2020) and the harmonic mean p-value Wilson (2019) were proposed as robust choices to combine p-values under arbitrary dependency structures to control type I error rate and improve power of analysis., Several preclinical pharmacogenomic meta-analyses have been performed in an effort to discover predictive biomarkers with consistent evidence across multiple research laboratories(Cohen et al., 2011 , Safikhani et al.,  2016 , 2017 , Haverty et al.,  2016 , Ding et al.,  2018 , Jaiswal et al.,  2021 , Xia et al.,  2022 )., However virtually all existing datasets suffer from missing observations due to limitations of the experimental techniques, insuf ficient resolution, and sequencing costs which prevent complete pro filing of cancer samples at the genomic and pharmacological levels ( Choi and Pavelka, 2012 , Basu et al.,  2013 ,  Muir et al.,  2016 , Li et al.,  2017 )., Notably the lack of either molecular ( Basu et al.,  2013 ) or pharmacological data [e.g., drug response Li et al., (2017) ] in a given study prevents its use for biomarker discovery. Hence investigators often attempt to makedatasets more complete by borrowing a subset of the data (e.g., molecular data,  drug response data, or combination of both) from one study and duplicating them in another study(Consortium of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer Consortium, 2015 ,  Safikhani et al.,  2016 , Li et al.,  2017 , Ding et al.,  2018 , Jia et al.,  2021 , Xia et al.,  2022 )., For instance the re-analysis of drug response consistency by the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer, investigators duplicated the gene mutation, copy number alteration and mRNAexpression when assessing the generalizability of biomarkers predictive of drug response (gene-drug associations) (Consortium of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer Consortium, 2015 ,  Safikhani et al.,  2016 )., In applied research detection of non- independent effects or duplicate study effects along with modeling dependency remain challenging., When study effectestimates are non-independent conclusions based on the conventional meta-analyses will bias the aggregated effects and can be misleading or even wrong ( Wood, 2008 , Cheung,  2019 )., In this study we reviewed and compared the performance of frequentist and Bayesian meta-analysis approaches to assess gene-drug associations or bi omarker discovery using independent large-scale br east cancer and pan-cancer pharmacogenomic datasets., We found that changes in thenumber and size of studies along with the type of meta- analysis methods can affect the identi fication of statistically significant gene-drug associations., We further conducted simulation studies to assess the performance of includingnon-independent studies or ef fects in a traditional meta- analysis approach., Results showed that as the number of non-independent effects increased higher relative meansquared error and lower coverag e probability were observed., In addition we aimed to evaluate the bias of avoiding the dependence of effects in traditional meta-analyses via preclinical pharmacogenomic data., To do so we showed how increases in the number of duplicated studies can impact the bias of estimated overall effect and theidenti fication of gene-drug associations., The results indicate that by increasing the number of dependent studies bias of estimated overall effect may increase and genes with lowersimilarity of measured expression across studies denote higher bias., 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Data types and sources We used transcriptomic (RNA-Sequencing and gene expression microarray) and drug response data from pharmacogenomic cancer cell line sensitivity screenings, including the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE,  Broad- Novartis) ( Barretina et al.,  2012 ), the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC, Wellcome Trust SangerInstitute) ( Garnett et al.,  2012 , Yang et al.,  2012 ), the Genentech Cell Line Screening Initiative (gCSI) ( Haverty et al.,  2016 ), the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP,  Broad Institute) ( Basu et al.,  2013 ), Oregon Health and Science University breast cancer screen (GRAY) ( Heiser et al.,  2012 ), and University Health Network Breast Cancer Screen (UHNBreast)(Marcotte et al.,  2016 , Safikhani et al.,  2017 )(Table 1 )., The cell lines gene expression pro files were generated using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in all datasets except for CTRP andGDSC datasets where the Affymetrix microarrays where used (Table 1 )., Molecular information was obtained from the PharmacoGx R package along with details on data processing (Safikhani et al., 2016 , Smirnov et al.,  2016 )., Cell line drug response data in the form of area above the curve (AAC) recomputed information, was also obtained from thePharmacoGx R package ( Table 1 )(Smirnov et al.,  2016 )., In this study we performed a breast cancer-speci fic and a pan-cancer analysis to assess the generalization of our results., Forthe breast cancer analysis we included seven independent studies, while the pan-cancer analysis excluded the UHNBreast and GRAY datasets as they included only breastcancer cell lines ( Figure 1 )., Pan-cancer data was filtered for tissue types containing at least 10 cell lines with available expression Frontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org 03Abbas-Aghababazadeh et al., 10.3389/fgene.2022.1027345 and drug response data ( Supplementary Figure S1 ). Breast cancer meta-analyses consisted of 11,198 genes and 19 cell lines shared between studies. To analyze pan-cancer data we selected 11, 340 common genes and 168 cell lines between studies.Common anticancer drugs such as Erlotinib, Lapatinib, and Paclitaxel across studies were used to evaluate gene-drug associations and discover biomarkers., Notably Lapatinib andErlotinib are a potent,  oral,  reversible, dual inhibitor of epidermalgrowth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2 or ERBB2) for breast cancer and a few other solid tumors ( Schlessinger, 2000 , Geyer et al.,  2006 , Medina and Goodin,  2008 , Iqbal et al.,  2011 )., Additionally Paclitaxel is a widely used drug for various solid tumors and breast cancer treatment, however, resistance occurs frequently and the evasion mechanisms remain unclear ( Volk-Draper et al., 2014 , Weaver,  2014 )., 2.2 Data pre-processing The drug dose-response curves were summarized into AAC values using a 3-parameter logistic model as implemented in PharmacoGx (Smirnov et al., 2016 )., The AAC values range between 0 and 1 with AAC close to 1 indicating the drugsensitive cell lines and AAC close to 0 indicating the drug resistant cell lines., Missing drug response data (AAC values) were imputed within each study to simplify further analyses.Imputation was completed via multiple imputation by classi fication and regression trees (MI-CART) ( Burgette and Reiter, 2010 , Burgette and Reiter, 2010 ) as implemented in mice R package ( Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn,  2010 )., For individual breast cancer and pan-cancer data analyses we focused on genes and drugs that were measured in all studies., To avoid scaling issues and make comparisons between the estimated effects across studies the z-score transformation (mean centered and variance scaled) was considered across cell lines using raw gene expression values and imputed AAC values., For a given gene Pearson correlation was applied to assessthe similarity of measured expression across studies.TABLE 1 Studies used in meta-analyses and corresponding drug response versions, number of cell lines,  and drugs along withmolecular data type., Different versions of GDSC study refer to drugresponse assays along with updated cell lines and drugs., (*) representsthe CCLE microarray data.

Tissue types contain at least 10 cell lines with available expression and drug response data included in pan-cancer analyses., Frontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org 04Abbas-Aghababazadeh et al. 10.3389/fgene.2022.1027345 2.3 Meta-analysis methods Let us consider Gmatched genes across Kstudies. For a given study k(k=1  ..., K), denote by xglkthe standardized gene expression intensity of gene g(g=1 , ..., G) and cell line l(l=1 ,  ..., Lk), where Lkrepresents the number of cell lines in study k. Let y lkbe the standardized imputed drug response variable of cell lineland study k. Under the breast cancer data, a standardized linear regression model was applied to assess the association of gene expression and imputed drug response, while adjusting forthe tissue types to evaluate pan-cancer data ( Peterson and Brown,  2005 )., For each individual gene-drug association analysis estimated effect, standard error of estimated effect,  andp-value were obtained., To identify a broad inferential basis for evaluation of estimated effects meta-analysis techniques were applied to integrate results of separate independent studiesincluding combining p-values and combining estimated effects (Supplementary Figure S2A )., 2.3.1 Combination of p-values Combining the p-values from multiple independent studies offers the bene fits of simplicity and extensibility to different kinds of outcome variables ( Tseng et al., 2012 )., Fisher s method ( Fisher et al. 1934 ) and Stouffer s method ( Stouffer et al., 1949 ) are widely used to combine p-value results from different independent studies., For each gene Fisher s method sums up the log transformed p-values obtained from individual study ( Fisher et al., 1934 )., The combined Fisher s statistic 2 Fisher/equals2/summationtextklog(pk)follows a chi- squared 2distribution with 2 Kdegrees of freedom under the null hypothesis., For each gene Stouffer s method sums the inverse normal transformed p-values ( Stouffer et al., 1949 )., The combined Stouffer s statistic TStouffer /equals/summationtextkzk//radicaltpext/radicaltpext K where zk=1(pk) and is a standard normal cumulative distribution function, it follows a standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis., Major limitations of such classical methods are that they do not account for the data heterogeneity and direction of effects., Additionally such methods are performed under the parametricassumption that p-values are uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis, though in practice such an assumption is not always satis fied (Marot et al.,  2009 )., 2.3.2 Combination of estimated effects Letkandskbe the estimated effect and its standard error in study k, respectively., The most popular parametric statistical methods for combining effects are based on fixed- and random- effects (FE & RE) models ( Cochran, 1954 , Borenstein et al.,  2021 )., The FE model assumes that all studies in meta-analysis share a single true effect (i.e. average effect across all studies) is specified as k/equals+k, where kis assumed to be independently distributed as k~N(0, 2 k)and within-study variance 2 k. Under the FE model, estimated effects are assumed to be homogeneous across studies and all differences in observed effects are due tosampling error or within-study variability, while in practice such an assumption is questionable., One of the challenges in meta- analysis is that true effects are different across studies. Hence theRE model was proposed to incorporate the variability of the estimated effects across studies in addition to the within-study variability using a two-stage hierarchical process as follows(DerSimonian and Laird, 1986 , Brockwell and Gordon,  2001 ,  Viechtbauer,  2005 , Bodnar et al.,  2017 )  k/equals+k+k, where kindicates the error accounting for the between- study variability., Assume error kis independently distributed as k~N(02), where 2is the between-study or heterogeneity variance of karound ., The marginal distribution of kfollows the normal distribution as k~N(2+2 k), where kandek are independent., A common assumption is that each study is based on studies large enough to consider the within-study variance as known and equal to the estimate provided by eachstudy (i.e., s 2 k)., The goal is to estimate the overall effect . Following the summarized assumptions in Supplementary Table S1 several approaches have been suggested for combining individual study results into an overall estimate of effect applying an inversevariance scheme ( Egger et al., 2008 )., Under the FE model the most flexible and widely used inverse variance-weighted average approach was proposed to estimate the overall effect as ^/equals/summationtextK k/equals1wkk /summationtextK k/equals1wk, w k/equals1 s2 k. However,  under the RE model, the proposed inverse variance approach is considered to estimate the overall effect where wk/equals 1/(2+s2 k)and the estimate of overall effect depends on the between-study variance., wkprovides the uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator of . A Wald-type 95% con fidence interval is estimated for the overall effect using the normalapproximation ( DerSimonian and Laird, 1986 )., The proposed RE meta-analysis approaches are typically performed in two stages where first the heterogeneity parameter is estimated, and then the effect estimate is derived using the estimated heterogeneity., One of the most troublesome challenging aspects of meta-analysis is the determination of whether thereis true heterogeneity, as it can in fluence the choice of the statistical method to combine estimated effects., 2.3.3 Measures of between-study heterogeneity Under the RE model the detection of heterogeneity requires testing the null hypothesis 2= 0, which corresponds to the FE Frontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org 05Abbas-Aghababazadeh et al., 10.3389/fgene.2022.1027345 model. The homogeneity hypothesis is tested using the Qstatistic (DerSimonian and Kacker 2007 ) given by Q/equals/summationdisplayK k/equals1k^ /parenleftBig/parenrightBig2wk which has an asymptotic chi-squared 2distribution with K1 degrees of freedom under the hypothesis of consistent or homogeneous association, and ^andwkare computed using the FE model analysis., The DerSimonian and Laird (DL) estimatorDerSimonian and Laird (1986) is possibly the most frequently used approach to estimate the between-study heterogeneity via moments approach given by ^ 2/equalsmax 0 , QK1 () /summationtextK k/equals1wk/summationtextK k/equals1w2 k/slashBig/summationtextK k/equals1wk  ., Note that the Qtest suffers from low power when studies have small sample size ( Lk) or are few in number ( K)(Hoaglin, 2016 )., More importantly the Qstatistic and the estimate of between-study variance depend on the scale of effects., Hence neither Qnor^ 2can be used to compare degrees of heterogeneity between different meta-analyses ( Higgins et al., 2003 )., Several approaches have been suggested over the years for how best toassess homogeneity across studies, and the corresponding research is ongoing., The relative amount of between-study heterogeneity can be expressed in terms of the measure of I 2/equals2/(2+~s2)that reflects the proportion of total variance that is attributed to heterogeneity ( Higgins et al., 2003 ).~s2is required as an estimate of the within-study variances., Unlike the Qtest I2can be directly compared between meta-analyses with different numbers ofstudies and different types of outcome data and also does not inherently depend on the number of studies in the meta-analysis (Higgins et al., 2003 )., Due to the low power situation of meta- analyses, Higgins et al. (2003) suggested that we could tentatively assign a signi ficant degree of heterogeneity (i.e. substantial heterogeneity) when I 2>50% and Qtest p-value <0.1 (Hoaglin,  2016 )., Many alternatives to the DL approach have been proposed such as modi fications of the method of moments, likelihood principle,  model error variance,  Bayes, and the non-parametric approaches with the aim of avoiding distributional assumptions (Veroniki et al., 2016 , Guolo and Varin,  2017 , Langan et al.,  2019 )., In this study we focus on six different heterogeneity variance estimators including moments estimators such as DerSimonian and Laird (DL) ( DerSimonian and Laird, 1986 ),  Paule and Mandel (PM) ( Paule and Mandel,  1982 ),  Hedges (HE) (Hedges and Olkin, 2014 ) and Hunter-Schmidt (HS) ( Schmidt and Hunter,  2004 ), error variance estimator Sidik-Jonkman (SJ) (Sidik and Jonkman,  2007 ), and empirical Bayes (EB) estimator (Sutton and Abrams,  2001 , Turner et al.,  2012 )., A common problem with such estimators is that they frequently producehigher numbers for small meta-analyses, and lower for analysesinvolving many studies which leads to inadequate heterogeneity and effect estimates along with challenges in the choice of FE or RE analysis methods ( Turner et al., 2012 , Bodnar et al.,  2017 ,  Langan et al.,  2019 )., To compare meta-analyses results, within each study, the effect size for each gene was measured. Meta-analyses for each gene were performed across studies using the meta (Schwarzer et al. 2019 ) and metap (Dewey,  2018 ) R packages., To correct for multiple testing the Benjamini & Hochberg procedure was used to control false discovery rate (FDR) ( Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 )., The Jaccard coef ficient index was applied to compare the similarity between the identi fied top-ranked genes associated with a drug using different independent meta-analyses., An UpSetplot was applied to visualize the number and the overlap of genes associated with drugs by considering different meta-analysis methods and volcano plot to highlight statistically signi ficant gene-drug associations., 2.3.4 Bayesian approaches Bayesian inference has been suggested in the context of meta- analysis to capture uncertainty in estimation of the heterogeneity by incorporating prior information ( Sutton and Abrams, 2001 ,  Bodnar et al.,  2017 , Rover,  2017 )., Compared to the earlier discussed approaches Bayesian methods offer several potentialadvantages which include producing a distribution for the effect and heterogeneity, leading to credible intervals for overall effect and heterogeneity., Within the explained two-stage hierarchical model (Supplementary Table S1 ) to infer the unknown hyper parameters and , prior knowledge needs to be speci fied where the joint prior probability can be factored into independent marginals p(, )= p() p()., The range of reasonably speci fied priors is usually limited. Non-informative or weakly informative priors for the effect are usually applied. However informative normal prior constitutes the conditionally conjugate prior distribution for the effect along with beingcomputationally convenient ( Rover, 2017 )., In addition for the between-study heterogeneity an informative prior is often appropriate especially when only a small number of studies isinvolved ( Bodnar et al., 2017 , Rover,  2017 )., Let p /parenleftbig/parenrightbig /radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext/radicaltpext /radicaltpext /summationdisplay K k/equals11 2 k+2/parenleftBigg/parenrightBigg2/radicaltp/radicalbt , denote the non-informative uniform and Jeffreys priors for parameters and , respectively Bodnar et al., (2017) ;Rover (2017) .

Assume available meas ured expression data xglksuch that k=k k=1 ,  ... , Kbe duplicated for the missing data (i.e., xglkx+ glk ) which leads to a lack of independence of effects across studies (i.e.,  k k)., In each meta-analysis (, K) denotes a set of all possible dependent studies by computing -combination of K studies, where =1 , ..., K1i st h en u m b e r of missing expression data., One of the considerable consequences of traditional meta- analyses of non-independent studies compared with independent ones is the signi ficant differences in the estimate of overall effect (Wood, 2008 )., Hence for a given gene and , to investigate the bias of ignoring the independence assumption of effects, the mean absolute deviation (MAD) metric is computed as MAD /equals1 ||/summationdisplay d^d^/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle, where ^and^ ddemonstrate the estimated overall effect by using the independent and non-independent studies, respectively., In addition we evaluate the association between increases in the number of non-independent studies and the similarity of measured expression across studies., The Jaccardsimilarity index was applied to compare the similarity between the detected top-ranked genes associated with a drug over duplicated study effects., We evaluate whether there is anincreasing trend in bias over the number of non-independent studies. Trend detection non-parametric Mann-Kendall (MK) (Mann 1945 , Pohlert, 2016 ) method is considered to test the null hypothesis H 0,  there is no monotonic trend in bias, versus the alternative hypothesis Haof an increasing trend of bias when the number of studies increase., The MK trend test followsasymptotically a normal distribution where a lack of samples may decrease the power of analysis to detect trends.2.5 Simulation study design Most simulation studies currently explore the performance of various methods by focusing on measuring inconsistency inmeta-analyses rather than in dealing with dependent effects across studies., Therefore we conducted a simulation study to investigate the performance of the widely used RE meta-analysisapproach (DL) in estimating the overall effect in which the dependence of the effects are ignored., We explored the effects of different parameters varied in the simulations including theheterogeneity across studies (  2),  number of studies ( K), variation in studies (2 k),  correlation between random effects ( ),  and overall effects ( )., When effects were correlated across studies the traditional RE method (DL) was applied to assess whether and for which conditions lack of independence assumption across studies produced signi ficantly different results., In this study we focused on the overall effect estimate and on its standard error, because applied researchers are often mostly interested in testing overall effect., 2.5.1 Simulation method and performance measures Parameter estimates and their performance measures are assessed in a 3( K)4( 2)3( 2)3 ( )4 ( ) factorial design (Table S2), where number of studies,  heterogeneity across studies,  variation within-studies, overall effects, and correlation between random effects are varied and eachscenario is tested using a DL meta-analysis approach., Note that the within-study variance is assumed to be equal. Under the explained two-stage hierarchical model for studies 1,  ..., K in each meta-analysis, true effects (  1, ..., K)are simulated from multivariate normal distribution NK(IK, ), where IKis a KKidentity matrix and the symmetric variance-covariance matrix /equals2+2 112121313/1k1K 21212+2 22323/2K2K ......... 1...

The correlation selected to calculate the Frontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org 07Abbas-Aghababazadeh et al., 10.3389/fgene.2022.1027345 covariances between study effects ranges between 0.1 and 0.7. To set one duplication scenario the 12had values 0.1 and 0.7, and to increase the number of duplications to two and three,  23and13 had values 0.2 and 0.6, respectively., Finally the overall effects are chosen to be 0.2,  0.5,  and 0.8 which are representing small, medium,  and large gene-drug correlation association., Simulating all combinations of parameter values leads to 432 scenarios for non-independent effects meta-analyses., The overall effect estimates were summarized across the 1,000 iterations. To evaluate the properties of the effectestimators we estimated the relative mean squared error (MSE) and the coverage probability of the 95% con fidence intervals by recording the percentage of replications whereintervals included the true overall effect., 3 Results 3.1 Comparison of meta-analysis techniques Independent studies We performed gene-drug association analysis for each study using (adjusted) standardized linear regression model to obtain estimated effect and its standard error along withp-value per gene., Meta-analysis approaches were applied to integrate information across studies including Fisher and Stouffer methods to combine p-values and the RE model to integrate estimated effects acr oss individual studies., Meta- analysis approaches differ on how they treat heterogeneity. Hence various heterogeneity approaches such as DL,  HS, PM,  HE,  SJ, and EB were compared (see Materials and Methods section)., To assess the performance of different meta-analysis approaches used to identify signi ficant gene-drug associations using breast cancer and pan-cancer pharmacogenomic datasets, we compared the lists of genes signi ficantly associated with drug response (FDR <0.05, Supplementary Figure S3 )., The p-value combination methods (Fisher and Stouffer) are almost the most conservative (least number of signi ficant genes) meta-analyses., SJ is typically less conservative compared to p-value combining methods while it is most conservative among the RE meta- analysis approaches., HS is always least conservative (greatestnumber of signi ficant associated genes). In addition a large percentage (~8 0 97%)of genes are found in common across the methods that are not most conservative., Othermethods including HE EB and PM demonstrate the similar pattern to DL method with more than 80% of commonly identi fied signi ficant associated genes., To compare the performance of different meta-analyses we computed the Jaccard index to assess the similarity between the ranked lists of gene pairs obtained from different meta-analyses(Supplementary Figure S4 )., We find that the top 100 ranked gene-pairs are most similar with a range from 65% to 100%across combining effects approaches except for the error variance estimator SJ., This observation of similarity measures suggests that meta-analyses are not identical and there is considerable diversity between combining p-values and effects approaches., Different types of meta approaches had been reviewed and compared ( Tseng et al. 2012 , Sweeney et al.,  2017 )., Hence we chose the less conservative and most commonly used DLmethod to estimate heterogeneity for the rest of the meta- analyses., 3.2 Breast cancer biomarker discovery We performed the association analysis between genes and drug response (AAC) using the RE meta-analysis model including the DL heterogeneity estimation approach to combine estimatedeffects (Pearson correlation coef ficient) across breast cancer studies (Figure 2 )., Drugs Erlotinib and Lapatinib demonstrate that 60% and 62% of genes are negatively correlated with FDR <0.05, respectively,  i.e.,  higher gene expression is associated with lower drug response, and therefore lower drug activity ( Figures 2A, B )., However Paclitaxel with 59% of genes correlated positively with FDR <0.05 represents higher gene expression is associated with higher drug activity ( Figure 2C )., In addition ERBB2 is highly sensitive to Lapatinib (overall effect = 0.74,  95% CI,  0.62 to 0.86, p= 2.69e-34),  while Paclitaxel and S100A1 are negatively associated (overall effect = -0.51, 95% CI,  0.66 to -0.35,  p= 1.53e-10) ( Figure 2 )., Moreover EGFR demonstrates less sensitivity to Erlotinib (overall effect = 0.16,  95% CI, 0.01 to 0.34,  p=6 ., 5 2 e - 02) compared to the breast cancer meta-analyses where not limitedto the common cell lines (overall effect = 0.26, 95% CI,  0.16 to 0.36,  p= 2.47e-07) ( Supplementary Figure S5 )., For breast cancer gene- drug association meta-analyses around 8% 13% of genes have substantial estimated heterogeneity, where no greater than 1% of them are signi ficantly associated with drugs., However almost 10% 30% of genes are associated to drugs with non-substantial estimated heterogeneity ( Supplementary Figure S6A )., 3.3 Pan-cancer biomarker discovery We considered the integration of estimated effects to assess the gene-drug association across pan-cancer data using RE meta- analysis including the DL heterogeneity estimation approach (Figure 3 )., We obtained that 50% and 60% of genes are negatively associated (FDR <0.05) with Erlotinib and Lapatinib, respectively,  i.e.,  higher gene expression was associated with lower drug activity, while 51% of genes are positively associated withdrug Paclitaxel ( Figure 3 )., EGFR and ERBB2 show considerable sensitivity to Erlotinib (overall effect = 0.33 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.40,  p= 4.23e-19) and Lapatinib (overall effect = 0.50,  95% CI,  0.44 to 0.56, p= 2.14e-52),  respectively ( Figure 3 )., However S100A1 is significantly resistant to Paclitaxel (overall effect = -0.21,  95% CI, Frontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org 08Abbas-Aghababazadeh et al., 10.3389/fgene.2022.1027345 -0.30 to -0.11, p=2 . 5 4 e - 0 5 )( Figure 3 ). Compared to the breast cancer meta-analysis the pan-cancer gene-drug association meta-analyses contain less studies and more cell lines where almost 5% 13% of genes have substantial estimatedheterogeneity and around 1% or less of them are associated with drugs., Moreover signi ficant gene-drug associated with non- substantial estimated heterogeneity ranges between 16% 20% (Supplementary Figure S6B )., FIGURE 2 Breast cancer independent meta-analyses. Volcano plots show genes associated with drug response using RE meta-analysis model and forestplots illustrate overall effect estimate using FE (red diamond) and RE (blue diamond) meta-analysis models using drugs (A)Erlotinib, (B)Lapatinib,  and (C)Paclitaxel., DL approach was applied to estimate heterogeneity across studies. Frontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org 09Abbas-Aghababazadeh et al. 10.3389/fgene.2022.1027345 3.4 Comparison of frequentist and bayesian meta-analysis To capture uncertainty in estimation of the heterogeneity, we applied Bayesian technique by incorporation Jeffreys priorinformation., We compared the performance of DL andBayesian approaches to estimate heterogeneity and overall effect along with 95% con fidence or credible regions., DL and Bayesian procedures yield almost the same estimates for the overall effect ( Supplementary Figure S7 )., For the breast cancer meta-analyses the Bayesian credible interval is between 1.37 and1.45 times wider than the DL interval, while as the number of FIGURE 3 Pan-cancer independent meta-analyses., Volcano plots show genes associated with drug response using RE meta-analysis model and forest plots illustrate overall effects estimate using FE (red diamond) and RE (blue diamond) meta-analysis models using drugs (A)Erlotinib, (B)Lapatinib,  and(C)Paclitaxel., DL approach was applied to estimate heterogeneity across studies. Frontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org 10Abbas-Aghababazadeh et al. 10.3389/fgene.2022.1027345 studies decreases using pan-cancer meta-analyses the Bayesian interval gets wider from 1.66 to 1.68 times of DL interval., The conventional DL method detects no or low heterogeneity while Bayesian estimate of I2ranges between 38% and 56%., In addition across all genes,  to compare the impact of Bayesian and DL methods, the length of 95% con fidence and credible regions along with estimate of I2were computed ( Supplementary Figures S8, S9)., The median of length of Bayesian intervals is 1.33 1.40 times of DL interval using breast cancer data, while considering pan- cancer data, the median of length of Bayesian credible becomesaround 1.52 to 1.54 times of DL interval across all drugs (Supplementary Figures S8, S9A )., The ranges of median of I 2 Bayesian estimates are (36% 42%) and (47% 53%) using breast cancer and pan-cancer meta-analyses, respectively (Supplementary Figures S8,  S9B )., Our results are comparable to those reported by Bodnar et al. (2017) due to assuming the same priors. 3.5 Simulation study and non- independent effects In traditional DL meta-analysis where the independence of effects was ignored, higher relative MSEs were observed as thenumber of non-independent effects increased ( Figure 4 , Supplementary Figures S10,  S11 )., However relative MSEs were similar across different numbers of non-independenteffects in scenarios with small variation within and across studies and large numbers of studies., In scenarios with a small number of studies relative MSEs were higher thanscenarios with larger numbers of studies., In addition, as the variation within and across studies increased, the relative MSEs gradually rose. We also observed that large correlation across theeffects can yield slightly higher relative MSE. As the overall effect increased, the relative MSEs had considerable decreases across all scenarios. Coverage of the 95% con fidence interval can differ by 5%  15% in all scenarios ( Figure 4 Supplementary Figures S10,  S11 )., As the number of non-independent effects increased, lowercoverage was observed. Coverage had variations up to 10% between numbers of studies. Coverage varies between almost 90% and 96% when studies are homogeneous and up to two non-independent effects included and can be as low as 80% in scenarios with a small number of studies and three non- independent effects., In addition large correlation across theeffects can yield slightly lower coverage than smaller correlation., As the overall effect increased, the coverage decreased gradually in all scenarios. The summary results indicated that the coverage of the 95% confidence intervals improved (or relative MSE decreased) as the number of studies increased, the variation within and acrossstudies decreased, and had a smaller number of duplications across studies.3.6 Duplicate study effects in a meta- analysis, Application in pharmacogenimic datasets Duplication in study effects has been de fined when estimated effect results from a complete replication of a particular study or from some subset of measured data., For instance the generatedexpression duplicated in the study contains missing expression data for a given gene ( Supplementary Figure S2B )., To assess the bias of ignoring the dependence of the effects we consideredmatched cell lines across non-independent studies for breast cancer and pan-cancer meta-analyses individually., Therefore across whole genes, we considered all possible duplicated studyeffects and applied the RE model, including DL heterogeneity estimation approach to integrate the duplicate study effects, to estimate overall effect and heterogeneity., Re flecting on duplicate data problems conclusions based on the traditional meta-analyses will bias the aggregated estimated effects and can increase the false positive results., Additionally bias is determined using the meandistance between the estimated overall effect using non- independent studies and the overall effect by integrating independent studies (i.e., MAD)., Additionally we investigate the association of violating the independence assumption over the similarity of measured expression per gene across studies byapplying the Pearson correlation., The median of estimated Pearson correlation can be classi fied as low | r|<0.3 medium 0.3|r|<0.7 and high | r|0.7 (Mukaka,  2012 )., 3.6.1 Bias assessment in non-independent meta- analysis Breast cancer and pan-cancer data We assessed the increases in the number of duplication using breast cancer data and its impact on the bias of the estimated overall effect using the MAD across drugs and selected genes withestimated substantial and non-substantial heterogeneity ( Figures 5AC)., The results indicate that increases in the number of duplicate study effects can considerably raise the bias of meta-estimates of effects., In addition testing the trend of bias across all genes by growth in the number of non-independent studies denotes almost 97% 99% of genes following an increasing trend with p-value <0.05 across drugs., Moreover we obtain genes with higher median Pearson correlations that show on average less bias compared with genes that have low levels ofmedian correlations across studies ( Figure 5D )., Additionally under the pan-cancer non-independent meta- analyses with more matched cell lines but fewer studies comparedwith breast cancer data, we obtain a similar increasing pattern in computed bias ( Figures 6A C)., To evaluate the bias changes across whole genes when more duplicate study effects were added inmeta-analyses, MK trend test results show almost 86% 93% of genes with p-value <0.05 were detected across drugs., Moreover similar to the breast cancer data, the average of bias across wholegenes was reduced as the median of Pearson correlations increases (Figure 6D )., Frontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org 11Abbas-Aghababazadeh et al. 10.3389/fgene.2022.1027345 3.6.2 Non-independent meta-analysis and biomarker discovery We evaluated whether violating the independence assumption in meta-analyses can impact on the differential expression analyses by considering Jaccard similarity index to compare the 100 top-ranked genes associated with drugs undernon-independent and independent meta-analyses., The results illustrate that if we have more duplicate study effects the overlap of detected expressed genes decreases and leads to a decrease inpower of analyses ( Figure 7 )., 3.6.3 Non-independent bayesian meta-analysis We also investigated how duplicate study effects can bias the meta-analyses using the Jeffreys Bayesian approach and compared the results with traditional DL meta-analysis., BecauseBayesian approaches take more time and are computationallyexpensive we only considered speci fic genes used by DL meta- analysis instead of including whole genes., We evaluated the pattern of changes in the number of duplicate study effects and the bias ofthe estimated overall effect using the Bayesian approach across drugs and selected genes., This process also considered estimated substantial and non-substantial estimated heterogeneity usingbreast cancer and pan-cancer data, respectively ( Supplementary Figures S12,  S13A C)., By increasing the number of duplicate study effects bias of estimated overall effect will increase and genes withhigher correlation across studies will indicate less bias., In addition we observed no considerable trend for the average of 95% intervals using Bayesian and DL meta-analyses by increasing the number ofduplicate study effects ( Supplementary Figures S12, S13D )., The results show that the median length of Bayesian intervals ranges almost between 2.4 and 2.5 times the DL interval using breastcancer data., When considering the pan-cancer data the median FIGURE 4 Mean squared error and coverage probability of overall effect estimates., Scenarios containing various within-study variances (row) andheterogeneity across studies (column). The x-axis represents the number of studies and the y-axis shows the relative MSE (A B) and coverage probability of 95% con fidence intervals (C, D) ., Set overall effect = 0.2.

Frontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org 12Abbas-Aghababazadeh et al. 10.3389/fgene.2022.1027345 length of Bayesian interval becomes around 4.6 to 4.8 times of DL interval across all drugs., 4 Discussion In this study we reviewed and compared the performance of various traditional meta-analysis including frequentist andBayesian approaches to improve the reproducibility of the identi fication of biomarkers using independent large-scale pharmacogenomic datasets., We observed that meta-analysesare not identical and there is considerable diversity between combining p-values and effect sizes approaches., We furtherassessed the bias of including non-independent effects (or duplicate data) in a conventional meta-analysis., When effectsare not independent conclusions based on these conventional procedures will bias overall effect estimates and in flate the type I error rates ( Becker, 2000 , Wood,  2008 , Lin and Sullivan,  2009 ,  Hedges et al.,  2010 , Scammacca et al.,  2014 , Van den Noortgate et al.,  2015 , Cheung,  2019 , Cooper et al.,  2019 , Liu et al.,  2019 , Wilson,  2019 , Liu and Xie,  2020 , Luo et al.,  2020 , Borenstein et al.,  2021 )., We demonstrated how increases in the number of duplicated studies can impact the bias of overall estimate of effect and the identi fication of gene-drug associations., We also evaluated whether violating the independence assumption in meta-analyses can impact on the biomarker discovery., FIGURE 5 Breast cancer non-independent meta-analyses (AC)bar plots demonstrate increases in the number of duplications and its impact on the bias of estimated overall effect using MAD metric across drugs and selected genes with substantial (blue) and non-substantial (gray) estimated heterogeneity estimation., Note that x-axis presents the number of duplicate study effects. (D)Violin plots show average of MAD values across non- independent analyses per genes over median of Pearson correlation of each gene s expression across studies, low (| r|<0.3),  medium (0.3 |r|< 0.7),  and high (| r|0.7)., Black dot at the box plot represents the median. Frontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org 13Abbas-Aghababazadeh et al. 10.3389/fgene.2022.1027345 Combining p-values and effects approaches are used to aggregate results from separate independent analyses., Although meta-analyses that combine p-values have widely been used before they were not able to address the directionof effects and data heterogeneity ( Marot et al., 2009 )., It was denoted that p-values combination methods (Fisher and Stouffer) are the most conservative and the HS RE model isthe least conservative to identify genes associated with drugs., Among approaches for estimating between-study variance SJ RE method is the most conservative method., Assessingheterogeneity is a critical issue in meta-analyses. Several statistical methods are routinely used to identify the statistical significance of heterogeneity which may lead to different estimates of overall effect and different standard errors(Veroniki et al., 2016 , Guolo and Varin,  2017 , Langan et al.,  2019 )., To address the uncertainty in the estimation of the heterogeneity in a RE model when studies have either small cell lines or are few in number, the Bayesian RE model wasproposed ( Bodnar et al.,  2017 )., The results indicated that the 95% Bayesian con fidence interval is considerably wider than the DL method, while both DL and Bayesian procedures yielded thesame estimate for the overall effect., In addition compared to the Bayesian approach, the DL method detected no heterogeneity which is comparable with reported results by Bodnar et al., (2017) . The most substantial outcomes of the non-independent studies are the signi ficant differences in the estimates of the overall effect., From the results of the simulation study as the FIGURE 6 Pan-cancer non-independent meta-analyses, (AC)bar plots demonstrate increases in the number of duplications and its impact on the bias of estimated overall effect using MAD metric across drugs and selected genes with substantial (blue) and non-substantial (gray) estimatedheterogeneity estimation., Note that x-axis presents the number of duplicate study effects. (D)Violin plots show average of MAD values across non- independent meta-analyses per genes over median of Pearson correlation of each gene s expression across studies, low (| r|<0.3),  medium (0.3|r|<0.7),  and high (| r|0.7)., Black dot at the box plot represents the median. Frontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org 14Abbas-Aghababazadeh et al. 10.3389/fgene.2022.1027345 number of non-independent effects increased higher relative MSE and lower-than-95% coverage probability were observed., However almost equal relative MSEs across different numbers of non- independent effects were observed in scenarios with small variation within andacross studies as well as large numbers of studies., Regarding the pharmacogenomics data analyses the results indicated that by increasing the number of duplicate studyeffects, bias of overall effect will increase and genes with higher correlation denote less bias., In addition when we have more duplicate study effects, the overlap of detectedassociated genes with drugs decreases and produces low p o w e ro fa n a l y s e sa n dm o r ef a l s ep o s i t i v e findings., Early meta-analytic researchers noted the non-independent study problem and suggested solutions. Doing nothing to correct dependent effects or accepting duplication in flate the Type I error and bias the estimated overall effect., Avoiding dependence byaveraging effects ( Wood 2008 ) or shifting unit-of-analysis (Cooper et al., 2019 ) can reduce the variance between effects while informative differences get lost., Additionally including thecorrelation between effects from the same study using multivariate approach, determining the covariance of effects across studies for overlap samples, and estimating the variancecomponents (e.g., between-studies and within studies) were proposed to deal with non-independent effects in meta- analyses ( Becker, 2000 , Lin and Sullivan,  2009 , Hedges et al.,  2010 , Van den Noortgate et al.,  2015 , Luo et al.,  2020 )., The mostcomplex strategy is to model the dependence by proposing multilevel models where the correlation between effect sizes from the same study is not needed and separate estimates of the different variance components are estimated., However when using multilevel models, it is very important to correctly specifyall relevant random effects in the model ( Cheung,  2014 , Van den Noortgate et al.,  2015 , Cheung,  2019 )., Moreover to combine p-values under arbitrary dependency structures, the Cauchy combination test ( Liu et al.,  2019 , Liu and Xie, 2020 ) and the harmonic mean p-value ( Wilson,  2019 ) were proposed., However the proposed methods may be less powerful or even powerlessunder some conditions ( Chen, 2022 )., In conclusion we should carefully de fine the inclusion and exclusion criteria and use these criteria to determine whether ornot the studies or the effects should be included., We have to properly incorporate the dependence in a meta-analysis by including the covariance of non-independent effects ormodeling the dependency., This research area remains challenging. Novel powerful and robust tests for combining non-independent effects are still highly desired. Data availability statement Publicly available datasets were analyzed in this study.

      "answer": "The main objective of the research in this paper is to investigate the impact of violating the independence assumption in meta-analyses on biomarker discovery, particularly in the context of pharmacogenomics. The study aims to review and compare different meta-analysis methods to estimate variations across studies and assess the performance of conventional meta-analysis techniques when the dependence of effects is ignored. The authors highlight how treating dependent studies as independent can lead to increased bias in effect estimates, decreased generalizability of biomarker discoveries, and an increase in false positive results, which poses significant challenges in precision oncology."

      "question": "Can you summarize the abstract of the paper?",
      "answer": "The abstract of the paper titled \"The impact of violating the independence assumption in meta-analysis on biomarker discovery\" discusses the challenges in biomarker discovery due to the violation of the independence assumption in meta-analyses. It highlights that while meta-analysis is a statistical tool designed to integrate independent studies for improved accuracy in biological insights, many biomarker studies often borrow data from other studies, creating dependencies. The authors review various meta-analyses to assess the variations in biomarker discoveries using pharmacogenomic data and conduct simulation studies to evaluate the performance of conventional meta-analysis methods that ignore these dependencies. The results indicate that increasing non-independent effects leads to higher relative mean squared error and lower coverage probability, ultimately biasing effect estimates and reducing the generalizability of biomarker discoveries. The study emphasizes that treating dependent studies as independent can significantly inflate bias and increase false positives, posing a challenge in precision oncology."

      "question": "Describe the methodology used in the paper.",
      "answer": "The methodology used in the paper \"The impact of violating the independence assumption in meta-analysis on biomarker discovery\" by Abbas-Aghababazadeh et al. involves several key components aimed at assessing the effects of non-independent studies in meta-analyses related to pharmacogenomics.\n\n1. **Data Sources**: The authors utilized transcriptomic data (RNA-Sequencing and gene expression microarray) and drug response data from various pharmacogenomic cancer cell line sensitivity screenings. Notable datasets included the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC), and others. The analysis focused on breast cancer and pan-cancer datasets, with specific filtering criteria for tissue types and available data.\n\n2. **Data Pre-processing**: Drug dose-response curves were summarized into area above the curve (AAC) values using a 3-parameter logistic model. Missing drug response data were imputed using multiple imputation by classification and regression trees (MI-CART). The authors standardized gene expression values and imputed AAC values to facilitate comparisons across studies.\n\n3. **Meta-analysis Methods**: The study employed both frequentist and Bayesian meta-analysis approaches. For each gene-drug association, the authors used standardized linear regression models to estimate effects, standard errors, and p-values. They combined p-values using Fisher's and Stouffer's methods and combined estimated effects using fixed-effects (FE) and random-effects (RE) models. Various heterogeneity estimators were compared, including DerSimonian and Laird (DL), Paule and Mandel (PM), and others.\n\n4. **Assessment of Non-independence**: The authors specifically investigated the impact of non-independent effects by simulating scenarios where the independence assumption was violated. They computed metrics such as the mean absolute deviation (MAD) to quantify bias in overall effect estimates when including non-independent studies. They also evaluated the association between the number of non-independent studies and the similarity of gene expression across studies.\n\n5. **Simulation Studies**: A factorial design was used to explore the performance of the RE meta-analysis approach under various conditions, including the number of studies, heterogeneity, and correlation between random effects. The authors assessed the relative mean squared error (MSE) and coverage probability of confidence intervals to evaluate the impact of non-independence on effect estimates.\n\n6. **Comparison of Meta-analysis Techniques**: The authors compared the performance of different meta-analysis techniques in identifying significant gene-drug associations, highlighting the differences in conservativeness and sensitivity of the methods used.\n\n7. **Bias Assessment**: The study assessed how the inclusion of duplicate study effects influenced the bias of estimated overall effects and the identification of gene-drug associations. They used statistical tests to determine trends in bias as the number of non-independent studies increased.\n\nOverall, the methodology combines rigorous statistical analysis with comprehensive data handling to address the challenges posed by non-independent effects in meta-analyses, particularly in the context of biomarker discovery in cancer research."

      "question": "What are the key findings of the paper?",
      "answer": "The key findings of the paper \"The impact of violating the independence assumption in meta-analysis on biomarker discovery\" by Abbas-Aghababazadeh et al. are as follows:\n\n1. **Violation of Independence Assumption**: The study highlights that many biomarker discovery studies in pharmacogenomics often violate the independence assumption by borrowing molecular profiles from other studies, leading to dependence across studies. This violation can significantly impact the results of meta-analyses.\n\n2. **Increased Bias and Error**: The authors found that as the number of non-independent effects increased, there was a corresponding increase in the relative mean squared error (MSE) and a decrease in the coverage probability of confidence intervals. This indicates that traditional meta-analysis methods can yield biased estimates when they ignore the dependence of effects.\n\n3. **Generalizability Issues**: The research demonstrates that violating the independence assumption decreases the generalizability of biomarker discoveries and increases the likelihood of false-positive results, which poses a significant challenge in precision oncology.\n\n4. **Simulation Studies**: Through simulation studies, the authors assessed the performance of conventional meta-analysis methods when the independence of effects was ignored. They observed that ignoring dependence led to misleading conclusions and inflated Type I error rates.\n\n5. **Comparison of Meta-Analysis Techniques**: The study compared various meta-analysis techniques, including frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and found that different methods yield different results in terms of identifying significant gene-drug associations. The Bayesian methods provided wider credible intervals compared to traditional methods.\n\n6. **Impact on Biomarker Discovery**: The findings suggest that the presence of duplicate study effects can lead to a decrease in the power of analyses and a reduction in the overlap of detected expressed genes, ultimately affecting the reliability of biomarker discovery.\n\n7. **Recommendations for Future Research**: The authors emphasize the need for careful consideration of study design and data handling to avoid the pitfalls of non-independence in meta-analyses. They call for the development of robust methods that can appropriately account for dependencies in effect sizes.\n\nOverall, the paper underscores the critical importance of addressing the independence assumption in meta-analyses to improve the accuracy and reliability of biomarker discovery in cancer research."

      "question": "How does the paper address potential biases in the research?",
      "answer": "The paper addresses potential biases in the research primarily by evaluating the impact of violating the independence assumption in meta-analyses, particularly in the context of biomarker discovery using pharmacogenomic data. Here are the key points on how the paper tackles these biases:\n\n1. **Identification of Dependence**: The authors highlight that many biomarker discovery studies often borrow molecular profiles from one study to another, leading to dependence across studies. This violation of the independence assumption can significantly bias the results of meta-analyses.\n\n2. **Simulation Studies**: The paper conducts simulation studies to assess the performance of conventional meta-analysis methods when the dependence of effects is ignored. The results indicate that as the number of non-independent effects increases, there is a corresponding increase in relative mean squared error and a decrease in coverage probability, demonstrating the extent of bias introduced by ignoring dependence.\n\n3. **Bias Assessment**: The authors specifically assess the potential bias in the estimation of effects when data are duplicated. They show that treating dependent studies as independent can substantially inflate the bias of meta-analyses, leading to misleading conclusions.\n\n4. **Impact on Generalizability**: The study emphasizes that violating the independence assumption not only biases the results but also decreases the generalizability of the biomarker discovery process, increasing the likelihood of false-positive results.\n\n5. **Statistical Methods for Handling Dependence**: The paper discusses various strategies to handle dependencies, including modeling dependence through robust variance estimation and multivariate meta-analysis. These methods aim to correct for the biases introduced by non-independent effects.\n\n6. **Empirical Evidence**: The authors provide empirical evidence showing that increases in the number of duplicated studies lead to a significant increase in bias in the estimated overall effect. They also analyze the correlation between the similarity of measured expression across studies and the bias in effect estimates.\n\n7. **Recommendations for Future Research**: The paper concludes by suggesting that researchers should carefully define inclusion and exclusion criteria for studies and consider the dependence of effects in their analyses. It calls for the development of novel methods to robustly combine non-independent effects in meta-analyses.\n\nIn summary, the paper systematically evaluates the biases introduced by violating the independence assumption in meta-analyses and provides both theoretical and empirical insights into how these biases can be assessed and mitigated."

      "question": "Are there any contradictions between this paper's findings and previous research?",
      "answer": "Based on the content of the research paper titled \"The impact of violating the independence assumption in meta-analysis on biomarker discovery,\" the authors highlight several key findings that may contradict previous research in the field of meta-analysis and biomarker discovery.\n\n1. **Independence Assumption**: The paper emphasizes that traditional meta-analysis methods often assume that the effects being analyzed are independent. However, the authors demonstrate that when this independence assumption is violated\u2014such as in cases where data from one study is borrowed or duplicated in another\u2014the results can be significantly biased. This finding contradicts the common practice in previous research where such dependencies were often ignored, leading to potentially misleading conclusions.\n\n2. **Bias and Generalizability**: The authors found that treating dependent studies as independent can substantially increase bias in meta-analyses, which in turn decreases the generalizability of biomarker discoveries and increases the rate of false positives. This is a critical challenge in precision oncology that may not have been adequately addressed in earlier studies, which often did not account for the impact of non-independent effects on the validity of their findings.\n\n3. **Performance of Meta-Analysis Techniques**: The paper compares various meta-analysis techniques and their performance in the context of pharmacogenomics. It suggests that conventional methods (like fixed and random effects models) may yield different estimates of overall effects when the independence assumption is violated. This contrasts with previous research that may have relied on these traditional methods without considering the implications of non-independence.\n\n4. **Simulation Studies**: The authors conducted simulation studies that showed as the number of non-independent effects increased, the relative mean squared error and lower coverage probability also increased. This finding challenges the reliability of results from meta-analyses that do not account for dependencies, which may not have been sufficiently emphasized in prior literature.\n\nIn summary, the findings of this paper suggest that previous research may have underestimated the impact of violating the independence assumption in meta-analyses, leading to biased results and reduced generalizability of biomarker discoveries. The authors advocate for more robust methods that account for dependencies among studies to improve the validity of meta-analytic conclusions in pharmacogenomics and precision oncology."
