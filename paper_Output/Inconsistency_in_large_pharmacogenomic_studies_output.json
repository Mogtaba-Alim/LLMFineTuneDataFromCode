NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript measures between these two well-controlled studies remains uncertain, it makes drawing firm conclusions about response very difficult and has potential implications for using these outcome measures to assess gene-drug relationships or select potential anti-cancer drugs based on their reported results., Our findings suggest standardization of response measurement protocols in pharmacogenomic studies is essential before such studies can live up to their promise., Patients with cancer often exhibit heterogeneous responses to anticancer treatments and evidence suggests response is determined in part by patient-specific alterations in the somatic cancer genome and changes in gene expression6., A number of studies have searched for gene expression signatures predictive of response however most only tested a limited number of genes,  a small panel of drugs, or assayed drug response in a small number of cell lines1, 7, 8., Results from two large-scale pharmacogenomic studies the Cancer Genome Project (CGP)4 and the Cancer Cell line Encyclopedia (CCLE)3, were recently reported in this journal., The CGP tested 138 anti-cancer drugs against 727 cell lines while the CCLE tested response of 24 drugs against 1036 cell lines (Extended Data Figure 1), of these,  15 drugs (Extended Data Figure 1a, b) and 471 cell lines were tested in both (Extended Data Figure 1d, e)., Both groups tested mutations in 64 genes (Extended Data Figure 1g) and expression of 12 153 genes (Extended Data Figure 1h) genes., The overlap allows assessment of consistency between these independent datasets and the potential to infer genomic models predictive of drug response., We downloaded curated, and annotated the genomic and pharmacological data from the CGP and CCLE studies(Methods)., We first compared expression profiles between the 61 biological replicates in CGP and observed very high correlation (median Spearman correlation of 0.97, Figure 1a) indicating excellent reproducibility within the same study., We then compared gene expression profiles of the 471 cell lines shared between studies. Despite the use of different array platforms (Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U133Ain CGP andHG-U133PLUS2in CCLE), the expression profiles of identical cell lines were significantly better correlated than between different cell lines (median correlation of 0.85 vs. 0.34 for identical and different cell lines, respectively,  two-sided Wilcoxon Rank Sum test p-value < 11016)., For 467cell lines the mosthighly correlated gene expression profile was with the same cell line, only four (MOG-G-CCM,  SNB19,  SW1990, and SW403)were more highly correlated with another cell line (Figure 1b)., This small discordance between the CGP and CCLE is likely due to experimental artifacts measurement error,  or divergence of the four cell lines., We tested consistency based on the tissue from which the cell line was derived (Supplementary Figure 1)., We found the highest correlation with cell lines from the urinary tract (median correlation of 0.87) and the lowest for those the upper aerodigestive tract (median correlation of 0.79), We compared the reported presence of mutations for 64 genes in the shared 471 cell lines and found better agreement between identical cell lines than between different cell lines (two-sided Wilcoxon Rank Sum test p-value < 11016, Extended Data Figure 2),  although not perfect agreement(median Cohen's Kappa [ ] of 0.65), which might be due to the Haibe-Kains et al., Page 2 Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 November 19. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript different sequencing platforms and software used to call genomic variants in the two studies., Agreement in mutation profiles was higher in pancreas cell lines although the difference was not significant (Supplementary Figure 2)., We then compared drug sensitivity phenotype measurements. In the CGP drug screening was performed at two sites the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI)., As a control Camptothecin,  an inhibitor of DNA enzyme topoisomerase I, was screened at both sites using the same experimental protocol in 252 cell lines., The IC 50 (concentration in micro molar [M] at which the drug inhibited 50% of the maximum cellular growth)for Camptothecin had significant but only fair correlation (rs=0.58., p-value=1.51023, Extended Data Figure 3). We compared drug sensitivity measures between CGP and CCLE in fifteen drugs (Extended Data Figure 1a, b) tested on the 471 shared cell lines (Extended Data Figure 1d, e)., Both CGP and CCLE measured cell line drug sensitivity usingIC 50 and AUC (area under the activity curve measuring dose response), also referred to as Activity Area5, however the two studies used different experimental protocols (summarized in Supplementary Information)., Differences include the pharmacological assay used the range of drug concentrations tested, and choice of an estimator for summarizing the drug dose-response curve., In both studies the IC 50 could not be estimated in many cases, as drug concentration necessary to inhibit 50% of growth was not reached., In CGP, IC 50 was estimated using a Bayesian sigmoid model for drug response. In contrast CCLE reported the maximum concentration for inactive compounds (referred to as placeholder values) rather than the extrapolated IC 50., AUC measures do not require extrapolation and can always be estimated from the dose response curve. For each of the 15 drugs assayed by both CGP and CCLE we ranked the response of the 471 shared cell lines(Figure 2a) and computed the Spearman correlation coefficient (see Methods) for the reportedIC 50 (Figure 2b)., We found a single drug 17AAG (an HSP90 inhibitor),  with moderate correlation ( rs=0.61, Extended Data Table 1a) and another,  PD0325901 (a MEK inhibitor), with fair correlation ( rs=0.53,  Extended Data Table 1a) between studies., To test whether extrapolation decreased the correlations between studies we filtered out all IC50 values exceeding the maximum tested drug concentrations., We observed only small increases in correlation for PLX4720 PD0325901 and Paclitaxel and decreases for 17AAG and AZD6244, although the number of measurements was small(Extended data figure 4)., We also compared reported AUC measures (Figure 2b Extended Data Table 1b, Extended data figure 5) and found that only two drugs yielded fair correlations (17AAG with rs=0.58 and PD0325901 with rs=0.55)., We compared correlations computed from AUC and IC 50(Figure 2b) and found AUC is more concordant between CGP and CCLE (median correlation of 0.35and 0.28 for IC 50 and AUC, respectively) but that the difference was not significant (two-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test p-value=0.3)., The vast majority of drugs yielded poor concordance ( rs<0.5) for Haibe-Kains et al. Page 3 Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 November 19. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript both IC 50 and AUC which suggests that the lack of consistency of the drug response cannot be solely explained by the choice of the estimator of drug sensitivity., We tested whether drug response correlation depended on tissue source. We found bothIC 50 and AUC measures tend to be more consistent in cell lines originating from urinary tract (Supplementary Figure 3), this difference is significant for AUC (two-sided Kruskal-Wallis test p-value=0.024, Supplementary Figure 3b)., However due to the small number of urinary tract cell lines (10),  only three drugs (PD0325901, Nutlin-3 and 17AAG) had statistically significant moderate correlation (Supplementary Figure 4)., In addition to IC 50 and AUC we also compared sensitivity using the waterfall method described in the CCLE study3., Drug sensitivity calls (resistant intermediate and sensitive) were estimated from IC 50 and AUC values and compared using Cohen's  (see Methods)., Again the drug sensitivity calls for both IC 50 and AUC estimates(Supplementary Tables 1 and 2) had a poor agreement between studies ( < 0.5, Supplementary Figure 5)., Despite the discordance in drug sensitivity measures between CGP and CCLE we tested whether the association between drug response and genomic features might be consistent across datasets., This is important because the identification of genomic predictors of drug response was the primary goal of both the CGP and CCLE studies., We estimated gene-drug associations by fitting for each gene, a linear regression model including gene expression as predictor of drug sensitivity, controlled for tissue source (see Methods)., Linear models were fitted using both IC 50 and AUC measures (Supplementary Files 2-5). Here too we observed poor correspondence between studies, the best correlation with IC 50 data was observed for 17AAG ( rs=0.38,  Figure 3a, Supplementary Figure 6 and Extended Data Table 1a), for the vast majority of drugs correlations were slightly better when AUC measures were used to estimate gene-drug associations but the best correlation was still poor ( rs=0.46 for PD0325901, Figure 3a,  Extended Data Table 1b and Extended data figure 6)., Although correlations significantly depended on tissue sources(tow-sided Kruskal-Wallis test p-value < 0.006), only drugs screened in hematopoietic/lymphoma tissue and urinary tract yielded slightly higher correlation than all tissues combined for both IC 50 and AUC (Supplementary Figures 7 and 8)., We tested whether these poor correlations could be due to genes unrelated to drug sensitivity by focusing on genes statistically associated with drug sensitivity (false discovery rate, FDR<20%) in at least one dataset., Overall while the correlations were better than those computed using all genes, they were still low., For IC 50 only AZD6244 and 17AAG yielded a moderate correlation ( rs=0.65 and rs=0.63, respectively,  Extended Data Table 1a,  Supplementary Figure 9)., Using AUC and this subset of genes we found that PD0332991 had fair correlation, and five drugs had moderate correlation between studies (PD0325901,  AZD6244,  Nilotinib,  17AAG, and Nutlin-3,  Extended Data Table 1b,  Supplementary Figure 10)., However the correlations for the remaining drugs remained poor (Extended Data Table 1 Supplementary Figures 8 and 9) and did not significantly depend on tissue source(two- sided Kruskal-Wallis test p-value>0.064, Supplementary Figures 11 and 12).Haibe-Kains et al., Page 4 Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 November 19. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript We recognize that activation of drug-response through specific gene functional classes may be more predictive than individual genes., We therefore used the previously computed gene- drug associations to rank genes by the significance of their association with drug sensitivity and searched for over-represented Gene Ontology (GO) terms using pre-ranked gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)9., We compared the normalized enrichment scores computed for CGP and CCLE for the 15 drugs screened in both studies (see Methods)., ForIC 50 there was poor correlation of GSEA enrichment scores for drugs, except for AZD6244 and PD0325901, which yielded fair correlation ( rs=0.63 for AZD6244 and rs=0.68 for PD0325901,  Figure 3c, Extended Data Table 1a,  Supplementary Figure 13,  Supplementary Files 6 and 7)., When using AUC two drugs yielded fair correlations (Nilotinib,  17AAG), AZD6244 yielded moderate correlation and PD0325901 yielded substantial correlation ( rs=0.76, Figure 3c,  Extended Data Table 1b,  Extended data figure 7,  Supplementary Files 8 and 9)., These correlations significantly depended on tissue source(tow-sided Kruskal-Wallis test p-value < 7104, Supplementary Figure 14) where median drug correlations computed from IC 50 were higher in breast, urinary tract, hematopoietic/lymphoma and lung cell lines compared to all tissues combined (Supplementary Figures 14 and 15)., We repeated the analyses this time focused on the GO classes that are statistically significantly enriched (FDR<20% for normalized enrichment score) among genes associated with drug response in at least one of the two studies., Using IC 50 most correlations increased slightly,  except for 17AAG and PD0332991, with PLX4720 and PD0325901 yielding moderate correlation (Figure 3c and 3d, Extended Data Table 1a,  Supplementary Figure 16)., For AUC we observed fair correlation for Paclitaxel and Sorafenib, moderate correlation only for Lapatnib, and substantial correlation for PD0325901 and AZD6244 (Figure 3d,  Extended Data Table 1b, Supplementary Figure 17)., These pathway-based correlations are the best observed in our analysis as almost half of the drugs exhibited a correlation greater than 0.5, although they are still quite poor., When stratifying by tissue source only drugs screened in lung cancer cell lines yielded slightly higher median correlation compared to all tissues combined (Supplementary Figures 18 and 19)., We then performed similar analyses using mutation data of the 64 genes sequenced both CGP and CCLE (Extended Data Figure 1g)., We observed that few mutations were significantly associated with drug response (Supplementary Files 11-13), which partly explains the poor correlation between mutation-drug associations (r s< 0.5, Extended data figure 8,  Supplementary Figures 20 and 21)., To test whether genomic data or drug response measures are the likely source of the poor correlations, we used identical (therefore perfectly correlated) gene expression data for the 471 cell lines while keeping the original drug sensitivity measures in each study, but did not find improved correlations for (significant) gene-drug associations (see Gene CGP fixed and Gene CCLE fixed in Figure 4)., However when using identical drug phenotypes with the original gene expression data correlations significantly increased in all cases (two-sided Haibe-Kains et al., Page 5 Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 November 19. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript Kruskal-Wallis test p-value < 0.01, see Drug CGP fixed and Drug CCLE fixed in Figure 4) and yielded almost perfect correlation for significant gene-drug associations with AUC (median correlation> 0.83)., Results were similar for pathway-drug associations (Supplementary Figure 22). These results clearly demonstrate that the discordance between studies stems from the drug sensitivity measurements., We also investigated the impact of the choice of pharmacological assay across study and compared CGP and CCLE drug sensitivity data with those published by Greshock and colleagues in a panel of 319 cell lines10, the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) data set., The GSK authors used the same pharmacological assay used by the CCLE (Cell Titer Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit from Promega), but other parameters in the experimental protocols differ from those in either CGP or CCLE and they used yet another model to estimate IC 50 values (model 205 in XL fit in Microsoft Excel)., Among the fifteen drugs shared between CGP and CCLE only two,  Lapatinib and Paclitaxel, were tested by GSK on a common set of 194 cell lines., As might be expected based on the assay used GSK IC 50 measurements were more consistent with those of CCLE IC50 (rs=0.42 and 0.36 for Lapatinib and Paclitaxel, respectively,  Supplementary Figure 23a) than CGP (r s=0.24 and 0.10 for Lapatinib and Paclitaxel, respectively,  Supplementary Figure 23b), but here too the overall consistency was rather poor (and similar to the observed consistency between CCLE and CGP)., We then performed the same analysis but focusing on drugs and cell lines shared only by two studies. For Lapatinib and Paclitaxel screened by CCLE and GSK in 249 common cell lines, we observed fair to poor correlations (Extended data figure 9a)., Five drugs and 231 cell lines were screened both in CGP and GSK (Extended Data Figure 1c) for these we observed poor correlation (r s ranging from 0.12 to 0.30,  Extended data figure 9b)., These results add further evidence that the inconsistency between studies stems from the use of different pharmacological assays, but there is no clear evidence to conclude which of the three approaches is more accurate., Indeed even if we observed perfect correlation between GSK and either the CGP or CCLE drug response assays, all that would indicate is a consistency in measurement, but not necessarily which provided the most meaningful assay of drug response or which could best be translated to in vivo response., Our analysis of these three large-scale pharmacogenomic studies points to a fundamental problem in assessment of pharmacologic drug response., While gene expression analysis has long been seen as a source of noisy data extensive work has led to standardized approaches to data collection and analysis and the development of robust platforms for measuring expression levels., This standardization has led to substantially higher quality more reproducible expression data sets, and this is evident in the CCLE and CGP data where we found excellent correlation between expression profiles in cell lines profiled in both studies., The poor correlation between drug response phenotypes is troubling and may represent a lack of standardization in experimental assays and data analysis methods., However, there may be other factors driving the discrepancy. As reported by the CGP, there was only a fair Haibe-Kains et al. Page 6 Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 November 19. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript correlation (r s< 0.6) between Camptothecin IC 50 measurements generated at two sites using matched cell line collections and identical experimental protocols., While this might lead to speculation that the cell lines could be the source of the observed phenotypic differences, this is highly unlikely as the gene expression profiles are well correlated between studies., While our analysis has been limited to common cell lines and drugs between studies it is not unreasonable to assume that the measured pharmacogenomic response for other drugs and cell lines assayed are also questionable., Ultimately the poor correlation in these published studies presents an obstacle to using the associated resources to build or validate predictive models of drug response., Because there is no clear concordance predictive models of response developed using the data from one study are almost guaranteed to fail when validated on data from the other11 and there is no way with available data to determine which study is more accurate., This suggests that users of both datasets should be cautious in their interpretation of results derived from their analyses., Clearly the investment in these projects warrants additional work to resolve the discrepancies in drug response phenotype so that the wealth of data that has been generated can be used to its fullest advantage., Our findings support the need for standardization of drug-response measurements or development of new, robust drug sensitivity assays,  without such assays, it will not be possible to reliably identify genomic predictors of drug response or effectively a drug's mechanism of action., Methods To ensure reproducibility of our analysis we developed an automated pipeline in R that can generate all the results, figures and tables of the paper (Supplementary data)., Data retrieval and curation We retrieved and curated data from three large pharmacogenomic studies namely the Cancer Genome Project (CGP), the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and the GlaxoSmithKline cell line collection., For CGP gene expression data (raw Affymetrix CEL files) were downloaded from Array Express ( http, //www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-783/ )., Drug sensitivity measurements mutation data and cell lines annotations were downloaded from the CGP website( http, //www.cancerrxgene.org/downloads/ )., Drug information was collected from Supplementary Information of Garnett et al.4. Minimum and maximum screening concentrations (M) for each drug/cell line were extracted from gdsc_compounds_conc_w2.csv available on the CGP website., The natural logarithm of IC 50 measurements were retrieved from column *_IC_50 of gdsc_manova_input_w2.csvavailable on the CGP website., The AUC measurements were retrieved from gdsc_manova_input_w2.csv in column *_AUC. Coding variants in 68 genes were also extracted from gdsc_manova_input_w2.csv. For CCLE gene expression, mutation data cell line annotations and drug information were downloaded from the CCLE website ( http, //www.broadinstitute.org/ccle ) Drug sensitivity Haibe-Kains et al., Page 7 Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 November 19. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript data were downloaded from the addendum published by Barretina et al.13., Screening concentrations (M) for each drug/cell line were extracted from Supplementary Table 11 in column Doses (M)., IC 50 measurements were retrieved from Supplementary Table 11 in column IC50 M (norm). AUC measurements were retrieved from Supplementary Table 11 in column Act Area(norm). Coding variants in 1667 genes (column Protein Change) measured using the Oncomap3 and hybrid capture platforms were extracted from CCLE_Oncomap3_2012-04-09.maf and CCLE_hybrid_capture1650_hg19_NoCommonSNPs_NoNeutralVariants_CDS_2012.05.07., maf, respectively. For GSK gene expression data and cell line annotations were downloaded from the National Cancer Informatics Program website ( http, //cbiit.nci.nih.gov/ncip )., IC 50measurements and drug information were downloaded from Supplementary Table 2 (stab_2.xls) of Greshock et al.10., Cell line annotations Cell line names were harmonized in CGP CCLE and GSK to match identical cell lines, this was done through manual search over alternative names of cell lines, as reported in the corresponding cell line annotation files and online databases such as hyper CLDB ( http, // bioinformatics.istge.it/hypercldb/ ) and BioInformation Web ( http, //bioinfoweb.com )., We identified 471 cancer cell lines being investigated both in CGP and CCLE 231 cell lines shared between CGP and GSK,  249 cell lines shared between CCLE and GSK, and 194 cell lines shared by all three studies (Extended Data Figure 1c)., To annotate the tissue of origin of each cell lines we chose the nomenclature used in CGP CCLE and GSK tissue type information was therefore updated to follow this nomenclature, which resulted in 24 tissue types., Drug sensitivity data Drug sensitivity measures which are IC 50 and AUC values, were set to common scale (log 10 (M) for IC 50 and [0, 1] for AUC) across studies so that high values are representative of cell line sensitivity to drugs., For CGP extracted IC 50 measures ( x) were transformed using log 10 (exp(x)/106) , and AUC measures were left untransformed., For CCLE extracted IC 50 measures ( x) were transformed into logarithmic scale,  log 10 (x/106) , and AUC measures were divided by the number of drug concentrations tested (8)., For GSK, extracted IC 50 measures ( x) were transformed using log 10 (x/103). We also discretized the drug sensitivity measures into three categories (resistant intermediate and sensitive) using the waterfall method described in the CCLE study3., The full procedure as provided by Dr. Kavitha Venkatesan (personal communication) is described below, 1.Extract the drug sensitivity measurements,  either IC 50 or AUC., 2.Sort increasing log IC 50 values (or AUC) of the cell lines to generate a waterfall distribution.Haibe-Kains et al., Page 8 Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 November 19. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript 3.If the waterfall distribution is non-linear (Pearson correlation coefficient to the linear fit  0.95), estimate the major inflection point of the log IC 50 curve as the point on the curve with the maximal distance to a line drawn between the start and end points of the distribution., 4.If the waterfall distribution appears linear (Pearson correlation coefficient to the linear fit > 0.95), then use the median IC 50 instead., 5.Cell lines within a 4-fold IC 50 (or within a 1.2-fold AUC) difference centered around this inflection point are classified as being intermediate, cell lines with lower IC 50 (or AUC) values than this range are defined as sensitive, and those with IC50 (or AUC) values higher than this range are called resistant., 6.Require at least x=5 sensitive and x=5 resistant cell lines after applying these criteria. Using this approach we generated drug sensitivity calls for all drugs in CGP and CCLE (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2)., Gene expression data Raw gene expression profiles (Affymetrix CEL format) for 789 CGP 1036 CCLE and950 cell lines were downloaded,  respectively,  from ArrayExpress14 (E-MTAB-783), CCLE (www.broadinstitute.org/ccle/ ) and NCIP ( http, //cbiit.nci.nih.gov/ncip ) websites., Gene expression data were normalized with frozen RMA15 using the Bioconductor Chip Description File (CDF) definitions (hthgu133a fro CGP, and hgu133plus2 for CCLE and GSK,  respectively)., We then used the R package jetset16 which maps Affymetrix probe sets to unique Entrez gene ids by selecting the best probe set for each gene, subsequent analyses were restricted to the 12, 187 probe sets common to the CGP, CCLE and GSK arrays., For replicates in CGP and GSK the CEL files were ordered by hybridization date and the first experiment was selected., Mutation data Missense mutations in 64 protein-coding genes sequenced in 431 cell lines both in CGP and CCLE were downloaded from their respective website., Similarly to CGP and CCLE studies34, mutation data were discretized to represent the presence or absence of missense mutation in a given gene in a given cell line., Gene-drug associations We assessed the association between gene expression and drug response referred to as gene-drug association, using a linear regression model controlled for tissue source, where Y denote the drug sensitivity variable, Gi and T denote the expression of gene i and the tissue type respectively, and s are the regression coefficients., The strength of gene-drug association is quantified by i above and beyond the relationship between drug sensitivity Haibe-Kains et al., Page 9 Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 November 19. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript and tissue source. The variables Y and G are scaled (standard deviation equals to 1) to estimates tandardized coefficients from the linear model., Significance of the gene-drug association is estimated by the statistical significance of i (two-sided t test)., Pathway-drug associations For each drug genes were ranked according to the statistical significance of their gene-drug association (Student t statistic)., We then used this drug-specific gene ranking to perform pre-ranked geneset enrichment analyses (GSEA9 version 2.0.13) in order to assess enrichment of gene ontology terms17 curated in MSigDB9 (c5.all.v4.0.entrez.gmt)., Only pathways whose corresponding gene sets contained between 15 genes and 250 genes were considered for further analysis (913 genesets)., We used the resulting normalized enrichment (NES9) scores to quantify the strength of pathway-drug associations., Measures of consistency We computed Spearman rank-ordered correlation coefficients ( rs)12 to assess the consistency between CGP and CCLE drug phenotypes (IC 50 and AUC measures), gene/ mutation-drug associations (coefficient ) and pathway-drug associations (normalized enrichment scores)., We used Cohen's Kappa ( ) coefficient18 to assess consistency between CGP and CCLE drug sensitivity calls (resistant, intermediate,  sensitive) and mutation data., We used the following qualitative descriptions of correlation coefficient ( rs) values associated with intervals, rs< 0.5,  poor consistency,  0.5  rs< 0.6,  fair consistency,  0.6  rs< 0.7,  moderate consistency, 0.7  rs< 0.8,  substantial consistency,  and rs 0.8,  almost perfect consistency., Same qualitative descriptions were used for Cohen's Kappa ( ) coefficient.Haibe-Kains et al.

      "answer": "The main objective of the research in this paper is to investigate the inconsistencies in drug response measurements between two large pharmacogenomic studies, the Cancer Genome Project (CGP) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). The authors aim to characterize the mechanisms associated with drug response by comparing gene expression, mutation data, and pharmacological responses across these studies. They highlight the surprising discordance in drug response despite high correlation in gene expression data, and they emphasize the need for standardization in response measurement protocols in pharmacogenomic studies to improve the reliability of identifying genomic predictors of drug response."

      "question": "Can you summarize the abstract of the paper?",
      "answer": "The abstract of the paper \"Inconsistency in large pharmacogenomic studies\" discusses the challenges faced in comparing drug response data from two significant pharmacogenomic studies, namely the Cancer Genome Project (CGP) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). Both studies analyzed a large panel of cancer cell lines for gene expression and pharmacological responses to various anti-cancer drugs. While gene expression data showed strong correlation between the studies, the pharmacological responses were highly discordant, with only one drug showing a significant correlation in response measures. This inconsistency raises concerns about the reliability of using these datasets to infer gene-drug relationships or to select anti-cancer drugs. The authors emphasize the need for standardizing response measurement protocols in pharmacogenomic studies to enhance the validity and utility of the findings. They conclude that without such standardization, it is difficult to draw reliable conclusions regarding drug responses and their genomic predictors."

For drugs tested in both studies, only one drug had a Spearman correlation coefficient greater than 0.6, indicating that the drug response measurements were inconsistent.\n\n3. **Impact of Measurement Protocols**: The discrepancies in drug response were attributed to differences in experimental protocols, including the pharmacological assays used, the range of drug concentrations tested, and the methods for summarizing drug dose-response curves (IC50 vs. AUC). This lack of standardization in response measurement protocols was highlighted as a critical issue.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Associations with Genomic Features**: The study also reported inconsistent associations between genomic features (such as gene expression and mutations) and drug response across the two datasets. This inconsistency complicates the identification of genomic predictors of drug sensitivity.\n\n5. **Need for Standardization**: The authors emphasized the necessity for standardization of drug-response measurement protocols in pharmacogenomic studies to improve the reliability of results and facilitate the development of predictive models for drug response.\n\n6. **Caution in Data Interpretation**: The findings suggest that researchers should exercise caution when interpreting results derived from these pharmacogenomic datasets, as predictive models developed using data from one study may not be valid when applied to data from another study.\n\nOverall, the paper underscores the challenges posed by inconsistencies in drug response measurements in pharmacogenomic research and calls for improved standardization to enhance the utility of such studies in clinical applications."

This included downloading gene expression data, drug sensitivity measurements (IC50 and AUC), mutation data, and cell line annotations.\n\n2. **Normalization and Transformation**: The drug sensitivity measures (IC50 and AUC) were transformed to a common scale across studies to facilitate comparison. For example, IC50 values were transformed using logarithmic scales, while AUC measures were left untransformed or adjusted based on the number of drug concentrations tested.\n\n3. **Statistical Analysis**: The authors computed Spearman rank-ordered correlation coefficients to assess the consistency between drug sensitivity measures (IC50 and AUC) from the different studies. They also used Cohen's Kappa coefficient to evaluate the consistency of drug sensitivity calls (resistant, intermediate, sensitive) and mutation data.\n\n4. **Gene-Drug Association Analysis**: The association between gene expression and drug response was assessed using linear regression models, controlling for tissue source. The strength of these associations was quantified, and statistical significance was estimated using two-sided t-tests.\n\n5. **Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)**: The authors performed pre-ranked GSEA to identify over-represented Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with drug sensitivity, using the rankings derived from gene-drug associations.\n\n6. **Comparison of Experimental Protocols**: The authors compared the experimental protocols used in the pharmacogenomic studies to identify potential sources of inconsistency in drug response measurements.\n\n7. **Automated Analysis Pipeline**: To ensure reproducibility, the authors developed an automated pipeline in R that could generate all results, figures, and tables presented in the paper.\n\nOverall, the analysis highlighted significant discrepancies in drug response measurements across studies, emphasizing the need for standardization in pharmacogenomic research."

This involved downloading gene expression data, drug sensitivity measurements, mutation data, and cell line annotations from respective databases.\n\n2. **Normalization of Gene Expression Data**: The raw gene expression profiles (Affymetrix CEL format) were normalized using frozen Robust Multi-array Analysis (fRMA) with appropriate Chip Description File (CDF) definitions for each dataset. The R package jetset was used to map Affymetrix probe sets to unique Entrez gene IDs.\n\n3. **Transformation of Drug Sensitivity Data**: Drug sensitivity measures (IC50 and AUC values) were transformed to a common scale across studies. Specifically:\n   - For CGP, IC50 measures were transformed using log10(exp(x)/106), while AUC measures were left untransformed.\n   - For CCLE, IC50 measures were transformed into logarithmic scale (log10(x/106)), and AUC measures were divided by the number of drug concentrations tested (8).\n   - For GSK, IC50 measures were transformed using log10(x/103).\n\n4. **Discretization of Drug Sensitivity Measures**: The authors discretized the drug sensitivity measures into three categories (resistant, intermediate, and sensitive) using a waterfall method based on the distribution of IC50 or AUC values.\n\n5. **Harmonization of Cell Line Names**: Cell line names were harmonized across the datasets to ensure consistency in identifying identical cell lines.\n\n6. **Statistical Analysis**: The authors computed Spearman rank-ordered correlation coefficients to assess consistency between drug phenotypes, gene/mutation-drug associations, and pathway-drug associations.\n\nThese pre-processing steps were crucial for ensuring the comparability and reliability of the data across the different studies analyzed in the research."

Only one drug tested in both studies had a Spearman correlation coefficient greater than 0.6, indicating a significant inconsistency in drug response measurements.\n\n2. **Impact of Measurement Protocols**: The differences in drug response measurements were attributed to variations in experimental protocols used in the two studies.

The lack of consistency in drug response measurements complicates the ability to draw reliable conclusions about gene-drug relationships and undermines the potential for these studies to inform drug selection and treatment strategies.\n\n4. **Implications for Predictive Models**: The authors caution that the observed discrepancies present significant obstacles to using the data from these studies to build or validate predictive models of drug response. Models developed using data from one study are likely to fail when validated against data from the other due to the lack of concordance.\n\n5. **Call for Further Research**: The paper emphasizes the importance of additional work to resolve the discrepancies in drug response phenotypes, suggesting that without improved standardization or new robust drug sensitivity assays, it will be challenging to reliably identify genomic predictors of drug response or understand drug mechanisms of action.\n\nOverall, the authors advocate for a concerted effort to enhance the reliability of pharmacogenomic studies to maximize the utility of the extensive data generated in these large-scale projects."

This inconsistency is unexpected given that both studies utilized common estimators for drug response. The authors note that only one drug tested in both studies had a Spearman correlation coefficient greater than 0.6, indicating a lack of agreement in drug response data.\n\nFurthermore, the review emphasizes that the discrepancies extend to the associations between genomic features and drug responses, complicating the ability to draw reliable conclusions about gene-drug relationships. The authors suggest that the source of these inconsistencies remains uncertain, but they stress the importance of standardizing response measurement protocols in pharmacogenomic studies to enhance the reliability of results.\n\nThe literature review also references previous studies that have attempted to identify gene expression signatures predictive of drug response, noting that many of these studies were limited in scope, testing only a small number of genes or drugs. The authors argue that the findings from CGP and CCLE provide a unique opportunity to assess the consistency of drug response across independent datasets, but the observed inconsistencies pose significant challenges for the development of predictive models based on these data.\n\nIn conclusion, the literature review underscores the need for improved standardization in drug response measurements and highlights the potential implications of these inconsistencies for future pharmacogenomic research and clinical applications."

The significance of these associations was evaluated using two-sided t-tests.\n\n7. **Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)**: The authors performed GSEA to assess the enrichment of Gene Ontology terms related to drug sensitivity, comparing normalized enrichment scores across studies.\n\n8. **Automated Analysis Pipeline**: An automated pipeline in R was developed to ensure reproducibility of the analysis, allowing for consistent generation of results, figures, and tables.\n\nThese methods collectively contributed to validating the findings and addressing the inconsistencies observed in drug response measurements across the pharmacogenomic studies analyzed."

      "question": "Are there any contradictions between this paper's findings and previous research?",
      "answer": "Yes, the findings of this paper present contradictions with previous research. The paper highlights significant discordance in pharmacologic drug responses between two large pharmacogenomic studies, the Cancer Genome Project (CGP) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), despite both studies using common estimators (IC50 and AUC) for drug response. While gene expression data showed high correlation between the studies, the measured pharmacologic responses were poorly correlated, with only one drug showing a Spearman correlation coefficient greater than 0.6.\n\nThis inconsistency challenges previous assumptions that drug response measurements in pharmacogenomic studies are reliable and reproducible. Previous research has often focused on gene expression signatures as predictive of drug response, but the findings of this paper suggest that the lack of standardization in drug response measurement protocols may undermine the validity of such predictive models. The authors argue that the discrepancies in drug response could lead to incorrect conclusions about gene-drug relationships and the selection of anti-cancer drugs based on reported results.\n\nOverall, the paper calls for a reevaluation of the methodologies used in pharmacogenomic studies and emphasizes the need for standardization in drug response measurements, which contradicts the notion that existing methodologies are sufficient for reliable drug response predictions."
