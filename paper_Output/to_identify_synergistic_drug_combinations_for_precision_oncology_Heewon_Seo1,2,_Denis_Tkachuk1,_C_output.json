(CLOUD dataset) ( 19) performed 1-by-1 combinations for synthetic lethality screening which resulted in the inabil- ity to apply ZIP (zero interaction potency) and Bliss meth- ods since they require a fitted curve (hill slope) and IC50, respectively., Friedman etal. (MIT-MELANOMA dataset) (20) introduced a unique design that involved performing twopairsofexperimentswithdrugsinlowandhighconcen- trationsforagivencombination.Wali etal., (YALE-TNBC dataset) ( 21) used a single fixed dose of FDA-approved drugs in combination with the experimental drugs at five doses.Second, twodatasetsincludedreplicatedexperiments (MERCK and VISAGE datasets) ( 22, 23), while the other datasets did not include replicates., For MERCK and VIS- AGE datasets the median viability from the experiments wastakenastheobservedvalue, resultinginlowernumbersof experiments and measurements., The median viability from the experiments was taken as the observed value and average and standard deviation of the synergy scores in 34preclinical model systems are provided in the Supplemen- taryFigureS2toassessitsquality.Third, thedrugdosesdo notmatchbetweenmono-anddual-therapyscreeningintheMERCK dataset ( 22), requiring the imputation of the via- bility for the corresponding doses in dual therapy from the drugdoseresponsecurveofthemonotherapyusinglogLo-gisticRegression and getHill functions implemented in the RPharmacoGx package (version1.6.1) ( 25)., To handle the variability arising from experimental de- sign issues we constructed a unified database of drug W496NucleicAcidsResearch, 2020, Vol.48, WebServerissue Figure1., Schematicoverviewof SYNERGxDB .Pharmacologicalandmolecularprofileswereintegratedintothedatabaseusingstandardizedcell-lineand compound names., SYNERGxDB provides a query interface where users can select cell line(s) compound(s), or dataset(s),  along with analysis modules includingforbiomarkerdiscovery, andeffectivevisualizationfunctionssoastoproducea prioritizedlist ofdrugcombinations., Table1.

For exam- ple we focused on expression-based biomarkers in the BT- combination, which dentified ATP6V1B2 as one of the potential biomarkers in the merged datasets (i.e., NCI- ALMANAC and MERCK) ( N=82, C-index =0.634, P =2.6E05) (Figure 5)., Because ATP6V1B2 was reported tobeoneoftheessentialbasal-specificgenesinbreastcan- cer (36) this biomarker could be used to identify samples that would benefit from this drug combination in clinicalsettings., SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS SYNERGxDB provides a unified framework to prioritize synergistic combinations by repurposing and re-evaluating existing drug combinations, allowing users to access and analyze molecular profiles to identify potential biomark-ers., To our knowledge SYNERGxDB presents the largest integrated database of both molecular and pharmacologi- cal profiles for drug combinations tested in in vitrocancer models, withrigorouscurationhavingbeenappliedtoiden- tifiers across datasets., Lastly the database allows users to identify potential biomarkers, which will need further pre-clinical and clinical validation., The integration of multiple profiles from different do- mains can provide a more-powerful and systematic ap-proachtoansweringcomplexpharmacologicalandbiolog- ical questions., There is a need for a computational frame- work that enables the integrated analysis of these comple-mentary profiles to improve predictions of drug synergism inpreclinicalsettings.Althoughmachine-learningandmul- tivariate statistical approaches are being increasingly usedfor predicting drug synergism, many prediction methods haveusedonlypharmacologicalprofilesinisolateddatasets., SYNERGxDB can be further used for machine-learning analysistoidentifyandtestpredictorsofdrugsynergiesus- ing both pharmacological and molecular profiles., We plan to integrate DrugComboRanker ( 37) and RACS (Ranking system of Anti-Cancer Synergy) ( 38) in our Web applica- tion along with our recent DNF (Drug Network Fusion) algorithm ( 39) to prioritize the list of drugs in combina- tionsbasedontheirchemicalstructures, transcriptomicper- turbations,  and the single-drug sensitivities., SYNERGxDB will ultimately provide a unique resource for investigating themechanismsunderlyingvariant-dependentresponsesto combination therapies using molecular profiles of cancercelllines, whichisakeysteptowardachievingprecisionon- cology., SUPPLEMENTARY DATA SupplementaryData are available at NAR Online.
