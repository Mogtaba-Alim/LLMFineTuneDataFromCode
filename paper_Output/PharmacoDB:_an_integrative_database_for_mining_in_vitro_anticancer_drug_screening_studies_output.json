experimental protocols used in high-throughput drug screening ( 18)., To address these issues we developed PharmacoDB the first database integrating multiple high- throughput cancer pharmacogenomic datasets (Table 1, SupplementaryFigureS1A).PharmacoDBprovidesanin-tuitiveinterfacetosearchandexplorethesedatasets(Figure 1A) based on cell lines and their tissue source, compounds and their targets (Figure 1B), and experiments in which cell viability is measured for cell lines treated with chemi- cal compounds (Figure 1C)., Moreover PharmacoDB pro-

 the curation process, anditsweb-interface., DATA COLLECTION AND DATABASE CONTENT Pharmacogenomic studies PharmacoDB seeks to include the largest published stud- iesinvestigatingtheviabilityresponseofhumancancercelllines to chemical compound treatment., To date we have curated seven major cancer studies,  The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) ( 8), Genomics of Drug Sensitivity inCancer(GDSC)( 7, 13), GenentechCellScreeningInitia- tive (gCSI) ( 10, 11), the Cancer Therapeutic Response Por- tal (CTRP) ( 20, 21), the Oregon Health and Science Uni- versity (OHSU) Breast Cancer Screen by Dr Joe Grays lab (GRAY) ( 9, 22),  the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland cell viability screen (FIMM) ( 12), and the Univer- sityHealthNetwork(Toronto)breastcancerscreen(UHN- Breast) (Safikhani et al., accepted,  Nat Commun 2017)., For each study we downloaded the cell line and com-pound annotations available with the original publications ofthestudy, eitherthroughthejournalwebsiteordedicated portals for data sharing made available by the study au- thors(Table 1, SupplementaryFigureS1A, Supplementary Methods).Annotation of celllines and chemical compounds We performed semi-automated curation of all the cell line and compound identifiers with the goal of discovering and maximizing the overlap between the datasets., First welooked for exact case-insensitive matches of the identifiers used in the dataset undergoing curation to already curated unique identifiers, if applicable., Second for all remainingcompounds and cell lines,  a partial, programmatic match- ing algorithm was used to generate candidate unique iden- tifier matches for each identifier used in the study., Thesecandidate matches were manually reviewed to find the cor- rect match for all compounds and cell lines which had a matchinguniqueidentifier.Third, wemanuallycuratedthesubset of identifiers for which there was no match using the compound and cell line names., For compounds we usedanyotherprovidedcompoundannotationssuchastheSMILES, InchiKey or PubChem identifier to match them withidentifiersavailableforpreviouslycuratedcompounds., If only the compound name is available we used the We- bChemR package (version 0.2) to query PubChem., If it was possible to retrieve the identifiers of these compounds then the third step was repeated to find possible matcheswith previously curated compounds., For cell lines which hadnocorrectmatchesinthesecondstep Cellosaurus( 23) wasqueriedtogeneratecandidatecellnamesynonyms, and manual matching was attempted with current unique iden- tifiers., If at the end of these three steps there remained anycelllineorcompoundnamesthatwerenotmatched anew unique, human interpretable identifier was created based on the name from the dataset currently undergoing cura- tion., This curation process maximized the overlap between datasets(Figure 2 SupplementaryFiguresS2andS3).Pro- grammatic matching almost doubled the number of com-pounds intersecting across datasets while manual curation further increased the intersection by 32% (Figure 2A)., Un- like compounds programmatically matching only moder-atelyincreasetheintersectionacross datasetswhilemanual curation was crucial to maximize overlap (Figure 2B)., At the dataset level while some intersections increased onlymodestly due to similar identifiers being used in the orig- inal studies, the benefit was substantial for others., For ex-

CTRPv2 quadrupled (Supplementary Figure S2B).Whilemanyofthenewlymatchedidentifiersdiffered only in capitalization or hyphenation, computational ap-proaches to mapping identifiers which ignore these differ- ences would be insufficient., These approaches would fail to match certain cases such as the matching of compoundnames AZD6244 and Selumetinib,  and would also cause mismatches,

weidentified1691uniquecelllinesfrom41tissuesourcesand759uniquecompoundswith673 associated targets.Annotation of drug targets To obtain a comprehensive collection of target proteins for the compounds included in PharmacoDB, the union of known drugtarget associations from four distinct data sources was integrated into the database., The CTRPv2study released curated annotations of the protein targets for compounds ( 20). Additional drug target annotations were retrieved programmatically from the Drug Repurpos-ing Hub ( 24), DrugBank ( 25),  and ChEMBL ( 26)., For DrugBankweretrievedthegenesymbolforeachtargetus- ingUniProt.ws (version2.16.0).ForChEMBL, weusedthe Web API to retrieve gene symbols for the protein targets, subsequentlylinked totheappropriate GeneCard ( 27, 28)., Comparison toexisting databases Current pharmacogenomic databases focus on cataloguing and curating relationships between genomic variants and theefficacyand /or toxicityof pharmaceutical compounds., PharmGKB currently annotates over 620 drugs with a to- tal of over 18 000 annotations ( 29).

Those with strong evidence and clinical significancearehighlightedforuseinclinicalpractice whileassociations with weak evidence or non-significant associ- ations are made available for use in research., PGMD an effort by Qiagen Bioinformatics, similarly starts with min-ing the pharmacogenomic literature, but aims to be wider inthescopeofgeneticvariationandadditionalannotations capturedinthedatabase( 30).PGMDincludesannotations about variants in intergenic regions, and maps each anno- tation to genomic coordinates, enabling the integration ofthis data into sequencing studies., This broader scope al- lowedPGMDtoincludeover117000uniquepharmacoge- nomic annotations encompassing nearly 1400 drugs., The DruGeVar database follows a similar literature mining ap-proach focusingonFDAandEMAapproveddrugswhich have a pharmacogenomic association on the drug label, leadingtoasmallerbutmoreclinicallyactionabledatabase(31)., While PharmGKB PGMD and DruGeVar rely on lit- erature mining to distill robust, clinically actionable phar-macogenomic associations, PharmacoDB focuses on the massiveinvitropharmacogenomicstudiesenabledbyhigh- throughput molecular profiling and drug screening as-says, which aim to be hypothesis-generating resources for biomarker discovery and drug repurposing., All the phe- notypical data included in PharmacoDB are derived fromdoseresponse experiments on cancer immortalized cell linesforapprovedandexperimentalcompounds, unlikeex- isting databases which mix evidence from preclinical and clinical studies., As such PharmacoDB is a resource for re- searcherswhohaveexhaustedtheexistingliterature, allow-ing them to mine existing data to discover evidence related to their compound or gene of interest, and enabling rapid hypothesis generation or invitrovalidation., DATABASE ORGANIZATION AND WEB-INTERFACE Database implementation All of the data is stored in a MySQL database running the default MyISAM database engine and with indexing con- figured on all tables in order to speed up queries (database schema in Supplementary Figure S4)., The web interface is
