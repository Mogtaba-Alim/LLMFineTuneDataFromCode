Although high-throughput screening of single-agent therapeutics has beensuccessfully implemented it is not feasible to test all possible drug combinations, even for a reduced subset of anticancerdrugs., Hence, in vitro and in vivo screening of a large number of drug combinations are not practical. Therefore devising computational methods to efficiently explore the space of drug combinations and to discover efficacious combinations hasattracted a lot of attention from the scientific community in the past few years., Nevertheless in the absence of consensusregarding the computational approaches used to predict efficacious drug combinations, a plethora of methods,  techniques and hypotheses have been developed to date, while the research field lacks an elaborate categorization of the existing com- putational methods and the available data sources., In this manuscript we review and categorize the state-of-the-art com-putational approaches for drug combination prediction, and elaborate on the limitations of these methods and the existingchallenges., We also discuss about the recent pan-cancer drug combination data sets and their importance in revising theavailable methods or developing more performant approaches., Key words drug combination,  cancer,  predictive methods,  pharmacogenomics,  machine learning, drug synergy Introduction Chemotherapy is considered as one of the main pillars in cancer treatments, and is used for both palliative and curative pur-poses., Despite enormous investments during the past few dec- ades toward identification of chemotherapeutic agents effectively killing the malignant cells, the response rate in mostcancers remains low [ 15]., Advances in molecular profilinghave shed light into the hallmarks of cancer [ 6]. Improved understanding of molecular biology of cancer and the evolutionof high-throughput technology enabled the development of tar-geted therapies that are chemicals targeting cancer-specific proteins or pathways [ 2]., For instance imatinib has been de- veloped to inhibit tyrosine kinase, which is crucial in chronicmyeloid leukemia patients with the breakpoint cluster regionabl (BCR-Abl) [ 7], gefitinib and erlotinib for non-small-cell lung Seyed Ali Madani Tonekaboni is a PhD student in the Medical Biophysics Department of the University of Toronto., His main research focuses on develop- ing a new framework for estimating proper drug combinations as a more efficient and less toxic chemotherapy., Laleh Soltan Ghoraie is a postdoctoral fellow in Dr Haibe-Kains lab at Princess Margaret Cancer Center., She received her PhD in Computer Science from University of Waterloo, Canada.

However evo- lution of tumors could result in resistant cancer populations owing to intra-tumor heterogeneity [ 10]., Different mechanisms such as mutation in the target domain and activation of alterna- tive pathways could result in resistance to targeted therapeutics[11]., In addition tumor subpopulations that were resistant to a therapy may survive and proliferate, giving rise to a tumor that does not respond to the assigned therapeutics anymore [ 1218]., To conquer the limitations of the monotherapy regimens combination therapeutics have been proposed a promising new therapeutic strategy [ 19]., The rationale behind this strategy is to overcome the complexity of cancer by targeting multiple compo- nents of the disease [ 1, 20]., Moreover it may be possible to in- crease the efficacy of each agent in the combination without escalating doses of single agents, resulting in lower toxicities in patients, decrease in resistance to a monotherapeutic agent or de- crease in the adverse effect of a monotherapy regimen [ 5]., For ex- ample targeting MEK and BRAF as two components of mitogen- activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in patients with melan- omas harboring BRAF V600E mutations shows less toxic effectand resistance with respect to targeting MAPK or BRAF inhibitors alone [ 11, 21, 22]., Therefore developing drug combinations with higher efficacies with respect to monotherapeutic strategies would be a chance to improve the control of tumor growth and survival of cancer patients., In clinic cocktails of well-known drugs,  as combination of two or more drugs, have been tested to control tumor growth in patients whose tumors are resistant tomonotherapies., However most of these combinations are the fruit of intensive trials and errors, and few have been designed based on our understanding of their mechanisms of action, leav- ing many challenges in identifying novel efficacious drug combin- ations and getting approval for their clinical usage., Although drug combinations appear to be a promising thera- peutic strategy with respect to monotherapy, developing new combination regimen to the clinical setting is difficult., According to the guidelines developed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization, justification of a combination ther- apy should be provided relying on the biology of the disease of interest and preclinical studies ( in vitro and preferably in vivo ) [23]., Two most common approaches to perform preclinical tests are cell-line-based systems ( in vitro ) and patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDXs, as an in vivo setting)., Combination of potential single agents in vitro helped the biomedical research to discover new potential and highly effective combinatorial chemothera- peutics for different types of cancers [ 2427]., However it has been shown that cancer cell lines do not fully recapitulate the molecular aberrations observed in patients [ 28]., In an effort to develop drug testing in vivo models several initiatives have been launched to screen single-agent and drug combinations in PDXs [ 2931]., A recent study from Novartis showed that responses of PDX models are more informative than the cell- line-based systems [ 31]., However applying PDX models is more expensive and labor-intensive compared with the traditional cell-line-based systems., Consequently, widespread use of the PDX models has been hindered [ 32]. Although high-throughput screening of single-agent thera- peutics has been successfully implemented [ 3335], it is not feasible to test all possible drug combinations, even for a small subset of anticancer drugs., Assuming 1000 single agents half a million experiments should be performed for only one dose pairwith one replicate., Hence, combination of more than two drugs may require billions of experiments [ 36,37]. Therefore, in vitro and in vivo screening of a large number of drug combinations are not practical. During the past decade computationalapproaches have been developed to overcome the limited throughput of experimental testing [ 3643]., The need to develop in silico predictive models of drug synergy resulted in launching two community challenges by the Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) consortium [44]., The first DREAM challenge on drug combination aimed at developing in silico methods to rank 91 drug combinations from most synergistic to most antagonistic., The combinations were tested on OCI-LY3 human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cellline [ 27]. More recently AstraZenecaSanger Drug Combination DREAM Challenge was launched with the same purpose but containing 85 cancer cell lines, and 11 759 drug combinationscreening for 118 drugs [ 44]., The data set provided in this chal- lenge as well as a recent drug combination study by ONeil et al. [45] including 583 doublet combinations in 39 diverse cancer cell lines, are the only pan-cancer drug combination data sets that have been released to date., Computational approaches and mathematical models used for analysis and prediction of combin ation therapies can be catego- rized as follows, (1) quantification methods, (2) predictive approach- es and (3) methodologies for optimal designs of combinatorialtreatment assays ( Figure 1 )., More than 10 models have been de- veloped for the quantification of experimental combination thera- pies [ 4657], and several reviews have been dedicated to compare these models [ 48, 5863]., The predictive models have been designed to differentiate synergistic additiv e and antagonistic combinations and predict new synergistic combinations in silico [27, 3643]., These computational approac hes incorporate multiple data types such as transcriptomic data [ 42] cell signaling pathway data [ 42], chemical similarity between drugs as well as available data of drug combin- ation experiments [ 27]., In the optimization category of methods the computational pipelines can be used to guide the experimental study by providing a list of combinations that potentially would in- clude more synergistic combinations [ 37]., Recent reviews describe a subset of the existing predictive models of drug combinations [ 64] system biology-based predictive methods [ 65] and the challenges in drug combination discovery [ 66]., In this review we provide a com- prehensive study of all steps in drug combination discovery in which computational biologists can contribute toward discovering novel combinations of therapies to treat cancer., The four widely used quantification methods namely,  median-effect,  Loewe addi- tivity, Bliss independence and highest single agent, are provided in enough details to use them for qua ntification of experimental drug combination data with enough knowledge about their similarities., Moreover we provide the details of the predictive methods for drug combination discovery in cancer to help computational biologistschoose the most adapted for their study and to improve over the state of the art., The assessment strategies are provided as well to emphasize the importance of the validation procedure., In additionwe discuss about the challenges regarding the quantification, pre- diction and assessment of drug combination response for cancer cells and the potential improvements to make the predictiveapproaches practical for clinical settings., Quantification of experimental drug combination The purpose of quantification models is to determine a refer- ence or non-interaction level in which a combination of drugs264 | Ali Madani Tonekaboni et al., is considered additive and the participated drug pair do not co- operate [ 63]. If drugs are non-interactive and the combination is additive the inhibitory effect of the drug combination, obtained using the median effect metrics ( Table 1 ), can be considered as the addition of the effect of each single agents., Deviation fromthe reference (or additive level) can be estimated and used tocategorize the combinations into antagonistic and synergistic [4657, 67]., There are multiple reference models including median-effect Loewe additivity, Bliss independence and high-est single agent, which can be used to quantify the experimen-tal drug combination data and classify them as synergistic/antagonistic with more/less inhibitory effects with respect tothe addition of the inhibitory effect of each drug in the combin- ation, respectively [ 23, 50, 56, 57, 63, 67]., Efforts during the past decades for quantification of the ef- fect of drug combinations with respect to the effect of the single agents resulted in several models such as median-effect, Loeweadditivity and Bliss independence (definition of some of the al-ternative methods can be found in references [ 23, 63])., Different steps in assessing synergism and antagonism using thesemethods are schematically shown in Figure 2 ., In these meth- ods a reference or non-interactive level is defined to identify synergism and antagonism as the positive and negative differ-ence from this reference, respectively [ 50, 56, 57, 67]., A continu- ous parameter usually called combination index (CI), can beobtained as a measure for deviation of the inhibitory effect ofthe combination from additivity ( Figure 2 )., Then CI can be used to categorize the drug combinations as being synergistic (CI <1), additive (CI /C241) and antagonistic (CI >1)., These different catego- ries can be also shown graphically in an isobologram proposedby Loewe ( Supplementary Figure S2 )[57]., The difference be- tween the integral of combinatorial doseresponse hyperplaneand the reference hyperplane (by adding the response of single agents) estimated from experimental sensitivity data can alsobe used to quantify synergism [ 45]., Software packages enabling the computation of Loewe additivity Bliss independence and median-effect methods are provided in Table 2 ., Median-effect approach Based on the median effect principle of the mass action law [ 57 67], this approach constructs the median effect plot as shown in Supplementary Figure S1 using the fundamental equation in this method fa/fu14(D/D m)mwhere fa is the affected (inhibited) fraction of the cancer cell population, fu(fu141-fa)is the corres- ponding unaffected fraction,  Dis the drug dose, Dmis dose required to produce the median effect (IC50, EC50) and mis a Hill-type coefficient signifying the sigmoidicity of the dose effect curve [ 67]., Then the equation Dx14Dm(fa/(1-f a))(1/m)is applied to obtain Dx, which is used to define CI as shown in Figure 2A ., Loewe additivity method Single drug doses and combination doses for the considered in- hibitory effect (such as IC50) are used to obtain CI for each com- bination ( Figure 2B )., Bliss independence approach In this method the additive effect is calculated as the summa- tion of the effect of the single agents in the given doses and compared with the observed inhibitory effect of the same drugdose combination as shown in Figure 2C ., Highest single-agent approach In this method CI can be obtained easily as the maximum effect of the single agents in the combination over the inhibitory effect of the drug combination (max(E a, Eb)/Eab)[23]., Figure 1.

There are various data types that can be used to predict the quantified measures of the drug combin-ation efficacy., Those data types are discussed in the followingsection. Potential data sources for predictive drug combination approaches The process of drug discovery includes three important primary steps, (1) the discovery of drug targets, (2) development of a li-brary of potential compounds and (3) investigation of the inter-actions between the compounds and the target [ 73]., To identify synergistic or antagonistic drug combinations, these datawould be available for the single agents in the combinations (Figure 3 )., This information can be used to predict the effect of the agents in combination and discover highly synergistic com-binations., The identified combinations can be validated in vitro and combinations with verified synergistic inhibition can bepassed to the next steps of drug development., Moreover thepredictive approaches can be used to recognize the antagonisticcombinations, which have to be avoided in the clinic., The fourmain categories of data that can potentially be used to predictthe efficacy of drug combinations are as follows., TargetTarget Interaction of target could be a direct interaction or an indirectinteraction via downstream pathways., Data regarding the po-tential drug targets and their interactions which have beenused in the literature to predict efficacious drug combinations, can be molecular profiling of tumor, such as genomic and prote- omic and their processed form such as signaling pathways and interaction networks [ 40, 41]., DrugTarget Putative targets of the single agents in a combination have also been used to predict efficacy of drug combinations [ 27, 42]., Bioassays are the common tests for drug target identification[73]. Existence of drug targets in the same pathway was shown to be predictive of synergism [ 1]. For example inhibition of MEK and BRAF as two druggable targets in MAPK pathway have beenshown to be synergistic in melanomas harboring BRAF V600E mutations [ 21]., Drugs in general can be categorized as single tar- get and multi-targets [ 1]. In the case of multi-target drugs com- binations could be even more efficacious than the combinationof targeted agents, as they can target a large number of features and pathways crucial to cancer cells [ 1]., DrugDrug Chemical information about drugs such as similarity of struc- ture and biochemical properties between drugs, and their func- tional classification,  such as anatomical therapeuticclassification (ATC), can be used to improve predictions of ef- fective combination therapies., Pharmacological Response of the cancer cells to the drugs under monotherapyand/or combination therapy,  can be used to obtain the potential Figure 3., Potential data for predictive in silico pipelines of drug combinations prediction including information about drugs, targets as well as response of the cell lines or tumor cells to drugs as single agent or in combination with other agents.Computational drug combination discovery in cancer |267 targets with similar response to the same drug or the drugs with similar mechanisms of action [ 26, 42]., Response of cancer cells to drug combinations can be helpful to use supervised learning algorithm while lack of such data for most cancer cell lines or tumor types causes difficulties to use supervised meth- ods in predicting the effect of drug combinations., Resources for each of these data types along with its related tools, are provided in Supplementary Table S1 ., Predictive computational approaches In the absence of consensus regarding the computational approaches used to estimate and predict drug synergism, a plethora of methods,  techniques and hypotheses have been de- veloped to date, and even benchmarked in the community- wide DREAM challenge [ 27]., We categorize the applied approaches by their mainly varying aspects as follows, (1) as- sumptions about drug combination synergism, (2) using a systems-based versus an isolated perspective to the problem, (3) exploring pairwise combination versus cocktail of drugs, (4) connectivity mapping (CMap) utilization and (5) the applied computational methods ( Table 3 )., Assumptions about synergism The underlying mechanisms of efficacious combinations are complex and highly dependent on the drugs of interest., Hence the research community has used various intuitive assump- tions about compounds crucial characteristics that can lead to synergistic combinations., Bansal et al. have reviewed the approaches applied by the groups that participated in the 2014 drug combination DREAM challenge, and categorized the mainassumptions as follows,  (i) similar compound activity, (ii) dis- similar compound activity, (iii) combination of similar and dis- similar activity and (iv) pursuing more complex synergistic relationships [ 27]., The three best-performing methods recog- nized by the DREAM challenge, used the first and third afore- mentioned assumptions., Studies performed before the DREAM challenge had applied similar assumptions. For instance, apply- ing the first assumption, Zhao et al. compiled a set of commonly enriched patterns in molecular and pharmacological data of known effective combinations, and used the patterns for determining synergism for new combinations [ 43]., Similarly, Li et al. assumed that combining drugs acting on the same or related functional pathways can result in synergistic behavior [74]., Alternatively drugs with independent actions, or drugs tar- geting different disease-related pathways, have also been assumed to have synergistic or complementary effects [ 39, 41]., Systems-based versus isolated perspective A systems-based approach views cancer as a complicated dis- ease resulting from interactions between many genomics, proteomics,  transcriptomics and metabolomics modules in the cellular system., Similarly, the drug combination problem can be viewed holistically as a systems biology problem. The interact- ing modules may reveal more information regarding the under- lying mechanisms of action for synergistic/antagonistic drugs., Systems-based approaches manifest the aforementioned modular interactions by constructing various cellular networks [3942, 74, 75],  and assume drug administration affects and modifies certain pathways, subnetworks and modules of these networks [ 75]., Therefore capturing those modifications and comparing them with the same cellular networks constructedfor the effective combinations can provide insight into mechan- isms of actions of single drugs, as well as suggesting effectiveapproaches to combine them., In contrast some computationalapproaches to drug combination prediction have opted for an isolated perspective., These approaches may either rely on one single data type for the prediction [ 3975], or applying multiple data types,  they do not use a holistic view, and do not take theinteractions into account [ 43]., Pairwise or cocktail of drugs combination Cocktail of drugs addresses combination of more than two drugs., Hence the number of possible combinations,  to be explored, is even larger than the number of pairwise combin-ations., Furthermore possible dosing schedules of each singleagent participating in the combination must be explored andoptimized as well., Therefore, the cocktail problem is computa-tionally more difficult and costly to tackle. Furthermore pos-sible dosing schedules of each single agent participating in the combination must be explored and optimized as well., Nevertheless, it is common to use combination of more thantwo drugs in clinical settings [ 7678]. While most of the efforts in the computational research community target the pairwisecombination problem, some of the approaches can handle drugcombination of arbitrary size as well [ 37, 74, 75, 79]., However to make the cocktail of drugs problem tractable, these approaches have to restrict the problem,  for instance, by limiting the num- ber of individual compounds [ 37, 75, 79]., Using CMap CMap [ 80] is one the large-scale pharmacogenomics data sets that have revolutionized computational pharmacogenomicsarea, single drug-repurposing and novel drug discovery [ 80, 81], and have provided an important tool for computational drug combination as well., CMap comprises two components (i) drug-induced gene expression profiles (also called geneticperturbations), and (ii) statistical pattern matching algorithmsto measure similarity between expression profiles induced bydrugs, diseases,  etc., We categorize computational combinationapproaches according to whether they use CMap framework. However CMap may be used as either a single fundamental data resource [ 39] or in integration with other data sources [ 41, 42, 75]., Computational methods Three main categories of computational methods are recog- nized in the drug combination literature, which are the explicit mathematical methods, stochastic search algorithms and ma- chine learning methods., Explicit mathematical methods Explicit mathematical methods refer to pipelines that apply oneor several direct mathematical models and statistical tests topredict the synergism in drug combination effects., The twobest-performing methods in the 2014 drug combination DREAMchallenge such as Drug Induced Genomic Residual Effect(DIGRE) and IUPUI_CCBB methods, belong to this category [ 27]., In contrast to machine learning approaches these methods do not rely on positive and negative samples to predict synergy be- tween drugs., Explicit mathematical methods aim to explicatethe relationship between drug combination synergy and268 | Ali Madani Tonekaboni et al., Table 3.

First a compound compound similarity measure is computed by comparing the perturbation profiles after treatment by individual drugs and by overlapping profiles with genes associated with the cell- growth-related pathways, extracted from KEGG database.Second, drug-response curve information and the similarity score are integrated via a mathematical model to estimate induced cell death by the compound combination., Finally, the induced cell death is calculated for both possible sequences of compound treatments. The two cell death values are averaged and used as the final cell death or synergistic score. For IUPUI_CCBB Goswami and Li assumed that a core subset of genes is responsible for drug inhibitory effects [ 27]., They identified differentially expressed genes for each drug treat- ment by comparing gene expression profiles measured at time point 6 h versus control., All the significantly expressed genes were combined to compile a unique gene list that formed the core gene set., Members of the core gene set that were signifi-cantly differentially expressed by both drugs were determined., Genes with the same and opposite direction of regulation in both drugs were determined as synergistic and antagonistic genes, respectively., Subsequently an interaction score was cal- culated based on the number of synergistic and antagonistic genes., The higher the score the more synergistic is a combin- ation. Probabilistic concordance index (PC-index) [ 82] was used to measure performance of the methods. DIGRE and IUPUI_CCBB both scored /C240.61, that is statistically significantly better than random. Leeet al. applied a CMap-based approach to the prediction of drug combinations [ 39]. The authors assumed that combination of two drugs regulating two different disease-specific path-ways,  can be synergistic., First a query signature, that is a list of genes whose expression is significantly associated with a dis- ease state or other condition of interest [ 80], is provided and highly enriched pathways in the query signature are identified by performing gene set enrichment analysis., Next gene expres- sion pattern matching is performed to measure similarity be- tween the query signature and drug perturbation profiles inCMap., For each identified pathway enrichment analysis was performed on the CMap drug profiles, and the drugs were rank- ordered accordingly., Assume two pathways P 1and P2are highly enriched in profiles of two drugs, A and B, respectively. The au- thors assumed that the drug pair could behave synergistically or complementarily if P2is enriched in the profile of the drug A,  and vice versa., The methods applied in this study were all stat- istical tests such as hypergeometric and KolmogorovSmirnov., Wei et al. generated a gene expression signature associated with glucocorticoid resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells [ 83]., Using CMap the authors identified the mTOR inhibi- tor rapamycin as a potential small molecule that reverses the resistance signature., Rapamycin is an FDA-approved drug andit has been given safely in combination with glucocorticoids to patients with organ transplant., The authors hypothesized and demonstrated that rapamycin induces glucocorticoid sensitivity via MCL1 modulation in lymphoid malignancy cells as well.Stochastic search algorithms Initial computational methods to tackle the drug combinationprediction comprised a category of stochastic search algo-rithms, named genetic algorithms [ 84]., In contrast to machine learning methods stochastic search algorithms do not requirepositive and negative samples (training data) to tackle an opti- mization problem., Applying genetic algorithms, Zinner et al. showed feasibility of screening drug combinations of arbitrarysize [ 37]. The authors aimed at discovering the most effective cocktail of drugs from a set of 19 drugs. For the first iteration 18randomly formed combinations comprised the first generation of candidate solutions., At each iteration level of fitness of each candidate combination solution was calculated by experimen-tally measuring the proportion of cells surviving (after treat-ment with the combination) relative to the control (no treatment)., The pool of candidates for the next generation is formed by the fittest solution in the current generation and itsone-mutant combinations, i.e., combinations generated by add-ing each of the drugs to or subtracting them from the fittestcombination., The algorithm converged fairly quickly (in the fourth generation) and the enormous search space of all per- mutations/combinations of the initial 19 drugs (2 19) was explored efficiently through only 72 experimental assay evalu-ations., Similarly, Wong et al. applied genetic algorithms to the combination problem but along with an alternative fitness function [ 79]., The authors explored a space of 1 million dose permutations of six drugs at 10 different doses rather than thespace of all combinations of the six drugs., One major advantageof these methods is applicability to drug combinations of arbi- trary size. However it is likely that these search algorithms con- verge to a local optima rather than a global optima, as the entirelandscape is not fully explored., Machine learning methods Using machine learning approaches one can generate predict- ive models by learning associations between input data (drug drug, drugtarget and targettarget) and drug combination in-hibitory effect that can be labeled, unlabeled or a mixture ofboth., The type of labels determines whether a supervised un- supervised or semi-supervised learning framework is suitable., Performance of machine learning approaches for drug combin-ation problem has suffered from lack of sufficient experimentaldrug combination data., However, these data are graduallybecoming more abundant and available [ 31,44,45]. This will open up new horizons for application of machine learning methods. Furthermore, machine learning methods facilitatecomplex integrations of various data types. Computational drugcombination studies have shown that systems-basedapproaches and integration of multiple data types such as pharmacological and omic play key roles in successful predic- tion [ 38, 42]., Therefore machine learning methods provide an important category of the computational methods for the drugcombination problem., Supervised methods Supervised machine learning methods aim at learning patternsfrom a set of labeled examples (training data) to predict un-known labels of arbitrary cases., In other words the method learns a function that describes association between input measures and the labels [ 85]., Currently lack of labeled drug combination data,  that is, known effective/ineffective or antag-onistic/additive/synergistic drug combinations, is a major270 | Ali Madani Tonekaboni et al., obstacle in application of supervised machine learning meth- ods. However a few studies have focused on using supervisedlearning methods to predict the label, class or quality of drugcombinations [ 38, 43]., For the first time, Zhao et al. aimed to devise a predictive model that could provide insight into drug combinations underlying mechanisms of action based on a set of 184 already approved pairwise combinations of 238 drugs [ 43]., The authors first, determined the enriched patterns in several pharmaco-logical and molecular properties of the approved combinations.The enrichment of a pattern was determined and scored ac-cording to frequency of that patterns occurrences in the effect- ive combinations., Then, based on the enriched patterns, Zhao et al. designed a set of predictive features to predict novel com- binations. The set of features contained target proteins and cor-responding downstream pathways medical indication areas, therapeutic effects as represented in the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System and side ef- fects., Applying F-measure maximization, Zhao et al. predicted a set of effective combinations 60% of which have been indicatedas synergistic combinations in the literature [ 43]., Liet al. applied a Bayesian network approach to integrate chemical and pharmacological features of drugs from a set ofknown effective drug combinations (EDCs) [ 38]., First, two lists of drugs, i.e. EDCs and undesirable drugdrug interactions (UDDIs), are compiled from the known drugs pairs. UDDIs refer to drug pairs that can cause an adverse effect such as an increase intoxicity or a decrease of effect., The authors collected 656 EDCsspanning 375 drugs and 1536 UDDIs involving 313 drugs forwhich six drugdrug similarity measures (three drug-based andthree target-based) could be computed., Hence for each arbi- trary drug pair, the six similarity features can be computed to describe similarity to a known drug pair., The six similarity fea-tures are combined via a Bayesian network to compute a prob-abilistic measure for similarity to every known drug pair., Then all probabilistic similarity scores to the known drugs aresummed up over each set (EDC and UDDI)., Therefore for each drug pair,  two similarity scores to EDC and UDDI categories can be assigned, and the scores can be used to determine the cat-egory that the new drug pair belong., Using the EDC set as thegold standard the method performed predictions with highspecificity and sensitivity [an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.90]., Unsupervised methods In contrast to the supervised methods for the unsupervised methods, the drug combination labels are not available, and thegoal mainly is to describe how the data are organized and whatis the hidden structure of the given data [ 85]., Applying an un- supervised method, Huang et al. combined drugs that target multiple disease-specific signaling pathways [ 41]. First the au- thors constructed a drugdrug interaction network based onperturbation profiles, obtained from CMap., Then they identi-fied communities within the drug network using Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization approach., A network-based rec- ommendation approach was applied on the drug communities to predict unknown drug targets according to the known ones.On the other hand, a disease-specific signaling network wasconstructed by integrating genomic and interactome data.Using the disease network and the predicted targets, Huang et al., determined drugs whose targets were enriched in comple- mentary modules of the disease signaling network., Those drugswere assumed to be synergistic by the authors.Parkkinen and Samuels unsupervised method was a novel probabilistic CMap [ 40] that basically extends the original CMaps methodology [ 80]., The main idea of the probabilistic model is to extract and differentiate between cell-specific and shared information among the cell lines, in contrast to other methods that aggregate information over all the cell lines., The authors viewed the pattern matching of drug perturbation pro- files from multiple cell lines as a multi-source information re- trieval task., They defined a new relevance measure for retrieving drugs with the most relevant profiles to a single querysignature., The new measure was devised based on group factor analysis (GFA) and probabilistic latent factor models., The prob- abilistic CMap method compares favorably with the original CMap in retrieving functionally and chemically similar drugs., Furthermore the authors showed application of the new method in drug combination by retrieving multiple similar drugs that match different parts of a given query signature., Semi-supervised methods One major issue in the drug combination field is data imbal- ance, i.e. lack of sufficient number of positive/negative samples(i.e. effective/ineffective combinations) and prevalence of un- labeled data. Sun et al. overcame this issue by applying a semi- supervised method named Ranking-system of Anti-Cancer Synergy (RACS) [ 42], based on a manifold ranking method pro- posed by Zhou et al., [86]. Sun et al. compiled a set of 14 features describing pharmacological and genomic aspects of drugs and their targets., The data used for this study comprised 26 effective combinations spanning >33 individual drugs. By reshuffling the 33 drugs, the authors obtained a set of 502 pairs of unlabeledsamples. Seven features of 14 were identified as significantly predictive features. The authors then applied a two-step method to rank drug pairs and refine them as follows. First themanifold ranking-based method obtained a preliminary ranking system for the drug pairs based on similarities to the positive samples., Next the ranking was further refined by filtering out drug pairs with insignificant coverage of specific cancer path- ways and insignificant overlap between their transcriptomic profiles retrieved from CMap., The authors validated their method by data provided for the 2014 drug combination DREAM challenge data, and achieved the highest prediction score withan AUC value of 0.85., RACS outperformed DIGRE the best- performing method of the challenge, and other well-known computational methods proposed for the combination problem., Assessment strategies Drug combination screening is an elaborate and costly proced-ure. Considering six doses for each drug in a pairwise combin- ation 36 measurements are required while 6 measurements are enough for monotherapy response of each drug separately., Because of this issue, only a few drug combination data set have been generated so far. Hence computational predictionsthat primarily rely on small data sets are hard to be validated computationally and experimentally., Previously tested combin- ations may be used to assess correctness of the predictions as in supervised machine learning methods [ 41]., Alternatively one may predict synergy measures or categorize the combinations using the available biological knowledge of the target cell lines [38, 42]., However two large pan-cancer drug combination data sets have been recently released [ 44, 45], which may help the scientists validate their approaches based on a richer datasource containing multiple tissue types and check the robust- ness of their predictions.Computational drug combination discovery in cancer |271 Various correlations and accuracy measures have been introduced in mathematical and statistical literature to test theperformance of predictive models using the available data sets.Application of these accuracy measures depends on the strat-egy of interest for assessment of the computational pipelines.For the classification strategy, contingency table [ 87] and its cor- responding measures such as Cramers V and phi coefficientscould be used as potential methods to check the accuracy of thepredictive drug combination methods ( Figure 4 )., For the score estimation strategy a common approach consists in rankingthe drug combinations and measuring the correlation of thepredicted rankings versus the gold standard using Spearmancorrelation, concordance index (as the generalization of AUC)[82, 88] and its modified form, named PC-index [ 27]., Challenges Lack of consensus definition for drug synergy There have been community efforts during the past two dec- ades to make a consensus on the quantification of experimentaldata and definition of synergy [ 89]., No single quantification method necessarily reflects the whole spectrum of possibledrug combination modes of action., Hence the available meth-ods for synergy estimation are exploratory in nature, whichcomplexifies the development of predictors for potential syn-ergy between drugs., Quantification methods such as Bliss inde-pendence and Loewe additivity have been used to quantify theexperimental data and validate the predictive methods [ 27, 37,  29]., However using other estimators of synergy is likely to re- sult in different quality assessment of predictive methods., Inthis regard reaching a consensus on the definition of synergy isone of the biggest challenges that the field is currently facing.Previous attempts have failed to provide a standard definitionfor drug synergy, including the Saariselk a agreement [ 90]., However, a recent review from Tang et al. described a simple ap- proach to combine the Bliss independence model and theLoewe additivity model into a interaction barometer [ 89]., This approach not only avoids the hard choice of a single synergyquantification method but also provides an interpretable scalefor drug interactions., More efforts in this direction will makethe development of synergy predictors more robust and com-parable across studies.Continuous versus discrete measures of drug combination synergy Applying a computational approach for predicting combination effect with respect to the reference, one can predict CI as a con-tinuous variable or categorize the combination as synergistic, additive or antagonistic., Although predicting CI as a continuousvariable can be complex it helps in eliminating the issue of thresholding in quantification of observed inhibitory effect of drug combinations., For instance assume two combinationswith CI values 0.98 and 1.05, solely relying on the definition ofsynergism (CI 141), one cannot determine whether the afore- mentioned combinations are synergistic and antagonistic, re- spectively., A CI value close to 1 with due attention to the ranges of CI for synergism and antagonism (synergism, 0<CI<1, antagonism,  CI >1),  makes the comparison difficult and challenging., Instead of summarizing the drug combination inhibitory ef- fects in a continuous variable or categorizing it as being syner-gistic/additive/antagonistic, considering the inhibitory effect ofdrug combination at each combination dose may be more rele-vant to drug development and clinical setting., A recent exten- sion of the PharmacoGx package ( Table 1 ) includes the four main quantification methods described in the Quantification ofexperimental drug combination section, such a unified imple-mentation of methods will help the cancer community comparethe quantified combination effects at each combination dose and check the consistency of the existing quantification approaches., Inconsistency of pharmacological profiling Experimental protocols used to generate pharmacological pro-files of single agents or drug combinations are complex and po-tentially noisy., Therefore the procedure can generate potentially inconsistent measures of drug sensitivities and syn- ergism [ 9195]., Such inconsistencies affect the performance of models for drug combination prediction. Therefore it is of theutmost importance to control the technical and biological vari- ability of the pharmacological assay carefully and to standard- ize experimental protocols to substantially increase the qualityof drug sensitivity data., Furthermore combination of multipleindependent data sets holds the potential to develop more ac-curate predictive models, and constitutes an essential step to- ward more EDC discovery., Data sparsity Many initiatives have been undertaken to generate large data sets of (i) targets such as the molecular profiles of cancer celllines,  (ii) drugs,  such as ChEMBL databases [ 88], and (iii) cell lines pharmacological response., However the data are still highly sparse, not all drug combinations within a data set have been tested and the screening is usually focused on one cancertype., Differences in molecular profiles of the cancer cell linesbetween tumor types and their signaling pathway activity areamong the important factors that make existence of cancer- specific data types essential for further predictions on the same cancer., Recently two pan-cancer data sets for drug combinationresponse,  containing multiple cancer types, have been released[43, 44]., These new data sets provide a unique opportunity to in- vestigate why drug combinations yield different response in specific cancer types., However it is important to note that is no or little data regarding drug combinations tested on liquidtumors, such as acute myeloid leukemia., Figure 4. Accuracy measures for different assessment strategies.272 | Ali Madani Tonekaboni et al. Generalizability of computational approaches One concern with the current computational approaches lies in their lack of generalizability to combination of new drugs andother cancer cell lines., Interactions between drugs are already complex in in vitro models and hard to capture by the existing computational methods., Hence, generalizability of these meth- ods to in vivo models and patients will be challenging. To be ap- plicable to in vivo setting other data types such as pharmacokinetic parameters may need to be considered in the existing predictive computational approaches., Intra-tumor het- erogeneity observed in many cancer types also complexifies the translation of in vitro prediction to in vivo settings as tumor sub- clones are likely to yield different levels of sensitivity to specific drugs, in both mono- and combination therapeutic strategies., In this regard new single-cell RNA-Seq data [ 96] may be helpful to investigate the response of the tumor subclones to drugs [ 97]., Performance assessment of predictive models Assessing generalizability of the predictive computational pipe- lines of drug combination in cancer is challenging owing to the lack of rigorous experimental validation., Most of the methods predictions have been validated by weak evidence of synergistic combinations in the literature., Although the first drug combin- ation DREAM challenge [ 27] was a breakthrough in this regard only 91 drug combinations in one B cell lymphoma were provided.Nevertheless, the recent large pan-cancer drug combination data sets [ 44, 45] will be crucial for the community to assess the robust- ness and generaliz ability of the developed predictive approaches., Future directions Most of the developed predictive methods for drug combination efficacy rely on a subset of molecular profiles of cancer cell lines such as transcriptomic profiles [ 27, 42]., However integration of other data types, such as mutation and copy number variation (as suggested by Astrazeneca-Sanger DREAM Challenge), may improve the performance of the methods [ 27]., Moreover the ul- timate goal in cancer community is to provide more effective therapeutics for cancer patients., With due attention to the dif- ferences between model systems and patient tumors the mod- els that are relying on the data types only available for cell lines, such as connectivity-mapping-based methods,  would have lesspotential in clinical practice., New data types High-throughput molecular profiles (also called omics) holdthe potential to elucidate the complex functionality of healthyand diseased cells., Among these molecular data transcriptomic profiles [ 27, 4042], interaction networks at the genomic and proteomic levels [ 38, 39] as well as biological pathways [ 27, 43] have already been used to predict the efficacy of drug combin- ations., However other informative molecular data can be lever- aged to predict the effect of combination therapies on the target cells., Mutation copy number variation and methylation dataare new data types, which have been provided by Astrazeneca- Sanger DREAM Challenge for use in the drug combination pre- diction pipelines developed by the participants (https, //www., synapse.org/# !Synapse:syn4231880/wiki/235651). Although chal- lenging one can integrate these multiple data types to predictthe efficacy of combinatorial cancer treatments and ultimately matching the drug combinations to the patients with the desir- able effect., For instance, functions of the target proteins maydiffer between their wild-type and mutated type. Hence targeting mutated proteins may cause synergy, while targeting their wild-type does not or vice versa., Although expression of genes can bedetermined using RNA-Seq or microarray technologies [ 98] copy number variation and methylation of the gene promoters providecomplementary data regarding the expression of a gene., Thesedata can be helpful in determining the activity and regulation ofthe target genes. For example investigating methylation data areessential to study the effects of epigenetic drugs in a monother-apy or combination therapy strategy [ 99]., Translation to clinic Translating computational predictions into clinical practice can be conceptualized with multiple stages, i.e., testing the drug com-bination predictions in in vitro and in vivo (both in genetically en- gineered mouse models and patient-derived xenografts) settings.Afterward, moving to the stage of clinical trials and testing thedrugs, which have been passed the preclinical trials,  on cancerpatients., Despite the successful validation of drugs in model sys-tems most of them fail to reach the approval of the FDA for theclinical use [ 100]., The bottlenecks associated with the computa- tional approach can be considered as 2-fold. First the molecularprofiles such as the transcriptional profiles,  obtained based onin vitro assays, that would be used in predictive computational approaches are distinct from the profiles of patients., To make thepredictions more applicable in clinics there is a need to figureout the similarities between in vitro and patient data in a person- alized setting., Second the methodologies that are relying onsparser data types, such as CMap-based models for which thedata are only available for few cells lines in restricted tissue types, makes the models less extensible and practical in clinical settings., Conclusively computational predictive models that relyon data types with more similarity between in vitro setting and patients as well as less dependent on the data types not availablein a personalized clinical setting would increase the applicabilityof the models in clinical practice., Although the preclinical studies and predictive computa- tional approaches focus on developing and predicting synergis-tic drug combinations, respectively, there are other concerns in clinical settings such as reducing acquired resistance to a monotherapy agent, or decrease its adverse effect [ 22]., Unfortunately the preclinical studies and the predictiveapproaches have not yet addressed these important issues., Conclusions Finding EDCs for different cancer types overcoming the limita-tions of monotherapy, is an elaborate and costly process., In thisreview we presented the current state of the art of computa-tional drug combination development., Although there has beena remarkable progress in the performance of predictiveapproaches there are still many challenges mainly owing tolack of experimental drug combination data., Nevertheless therecent pan-cancer drug combination data sets will be crucialsources for improving and extending existing methods, as wellas developing new approaches in the near future., Key Points We synthesize the different aspects of the available computational and mathematical models used in drug combination development.Computational drug combination discovery in cancer |273 Various data types, including genomic,  proteomic,  chemical structure and pharmacological, are publiclyavailable for developing predictive drug combinationapproaches., Recent pan-cancer drug combination data sets will be crucial for developing the next generation of predictivedrug combination methods., Supplementary Data http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/.
