Other pharmacogenomic studies, such as the Connectivity Map pro-ject ( Lamb et al. 2 0 0 6 ) characterized the transcriptional changes induced by a large set of drugs, these data are referred to as drug per- turbation datasets ., For the full potential of these pharmacogenomics to be realized new analytical approaches must be developed to bestleverage the large quantity of valuable molecular and pharmacologicaldata in the context of drug discovery and biomarker development.However, the lack of standardization of experimental protocols andannotations hinders meta-analysis of large pharmacogenomic studies., To address these issues we developed PharmacoGx an R pack- age enabling users to download and interrogate large pharmacoge-nomic datasets that were extensively curated to ensure maximumoverlap and consistency., PharmacoGx provides parallelized func- tions not only to assess the reproducibility of pharmacological andmolecular data, but also to identify the molecular features that areconsistently associated with drug effects., 2 Package 2.1 Data To efficiently store and analyze large pharmacogenomic datasets we developed the PharmacoSet class (also referred to as PSet ), which acts as a data container storing pharmacological and molecu-lar data along with experimental metadata (detailed structure pro-vided in Supplementary materials )., This class enables efficient implementation of curated annotations for cell lines drug com- pounds and molecular features, which facilitates comparisons be-tween different datasets stored as PharmacoSet objects., 2.2 Curation of drug cell line and molecular feature identifiers The lack of standardization for cell line names and drug identifiers represents a major barrier for performing comparative analyses oflarge pharmacogenomics studies, such as GDSC and CCLE., Wetherefore curated these datasets to maximize the overlap in cell linesand drugs. Assigning a unique identifier to each cell line and drug we matched entities with the same unique identifier., Manual searchwas then applied to match any remaining cell lines or drugs whichdid not match based on string similarity., Drug similarity was con-firmed by examining the extended fingerprint of each of theirSMILES strings and ensuring that the Tanimoto similarity betweentwo drugs called as the same, as determined by this fingerprint,  was>0.95., While standards exist for annotating genomic features the proper mapping between microarray probe expression to genomic expression is still not entirely determined., We therefore used the BrainArray annotations which are updated to reflect recent annota-tion of the human genome to perform the mapping from microarrayprobe to genomic expression ( Daiet al., 2005 )., 2.3 Functions We have implemented a suite of functions facilitating the explor- ation and analysis of large pharmacogenomic datasets., The functiondownloadPSet allow users to directly download PharmacoSet objects that have been previously curated by our team., To performcomparative analysis between datasets the lack of standards fordrug and cell line identifiers must be overcome., We therefore imple-mented the intersectPSets function to make use of our exten- sive curation of the datasets for identifying the drugs and cell linescommonly screened in the PharmacoSet objects provided as input., We also included functions to explore the pharmacological measure-ments generated in the drug-sensitivity datasets., Full drug doseresponse curves can be plotted using drugDoseResponseCurve and well-established drug-sensitivity estimates, such as the concen-tration at which the drug inhibited 50% of the maximum cellulargrowth (IC 50) and the area under the curve (AUC), can be computed using summarizeSensitivityPhenotype ., To link molecular features to drug sensitivity the drugSensitivitySig function can be used to quantify the strength of each genedrug associationusing a regression model controlled for treatment duration, tissuetype and batch variables., Similarly the drugPerturbationSig function allows users to identify differential gene expressionsinduced by drug treatment., Finally the connectivityScore function can then be used to compare drug signatures against diseasesignatures (tumor versus normal for instance) in order to identifydrugs with carcinogenic ( Caiment et al., , 2013 ) or therapeutic potential ( Sirota et al., 2011 ). 3 Case studies We present here two case studies exploring drug sensitivity and per- turbation datasets using PharmacoGx ., The full code is provided in Supplementary material . 3.1 (In)consistency across large pharmacogenomic studies The curated and structured aspects of our package make it easy to compare large-scale pharmacogenomic studies., We sought toFig. 1 .

The most updated versions of GDSC and CCLE datasets have been curated into PharmacoSets that can be directly downloaded using downloadPSet ., The 15 drugs and 698 cell lines screened in both studies can be identified usingintersectPSets (Fig. 1AC ). Next we can assess the concordance of all the drug-sensitivity measurements in CCLE and GDSC usingthesummarizeSensitivityPhenotype function ( Fig., 1D ). We can then use drugDoseResponseCurve to plot the (in)consistent experiments ( Fig. 1EG; Supplementary Fig. S1 ). In order to assess the impact of such inconsistencies in the biomarker discovery processwe sought to compute the strength and significance of known genedrug associations in the updated GDSC and CCLE datasets., We there-fore used the drugSensitivitySig function to investigate muta- tions copy number variations and gene expressions that have beenreported in the literature as predictive of response to specific targeted drugs., For instance we confirmed in GDSC and CCLE that mutation in BRAF was associated with response to the MEK inhibitor PD-0325901, that NQO1 expression was predictive of response to theHSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG and that the cell lines with ERBB2 amplifi-cation was significantly more sensitive to lapatinib (seeSupplementary Material )., The reproducibility of these known bio- markers supports the relevance of the GDSC and CCLE datasets des-pite the observed inconsistency in drug-sensitivity data., 3.2 Query the connectivity map We further illustrated the ease of use of our package by linking drugperturbation signatures inferred from CMAP to independent signa-tures of HDAC inhibitors published in Glaser et al., (2003) .W e therefore sought to reproduce the HDAC analysis in Lamb et al. (2006) using the latest version of CMAP that can be downloaded using downloadPSet . The connectivityScore function en- ables the computation of the connectivity scores between the 14-gene HDAC signature from ( Glaser et al., , 2003 ) and over 1000 CMAP drugs. This analysis results in the four HDAC inhibitors inCMAP being ranked at the top of the drug list ( Fig., 2 ), therefore concurring with the original CMAP analysis ( Lamb et al., 2006 ). 4 Conclusion ThePharmacoGx package enables easy and efficient analysis of the increasingly available compendium of pharmacogenomic data.To the best of the authors knowledge, this package is the first to integrate multiple pharmacogenomic datasets using structured ob-jects incorporating standardization of cell line and drug identifiers.PharmacoGx includes functions to link molecular features to drug sensitivity and perturbation phenotypes, therefore providing witha unified framework to develop drug-related molecular signatures.Given that the GDSC and CCLE PharmacoSet objects contain multiple types of molecular profiles, which are linked to pharma-cological profiles, these datasets open new avenues of research forthe development of integrative biomarkers of drug response., Asmore datasets will be curated in PharmacoSets our package will enable meta-analysis of large pharmacogenomic studies, with theaim to build better biomarkers by using multiple datasets in thediscovery phase., Generation of robust biomarkers of drug responsew o u l dc o n s t i t u t eam a j o rs t e pt o w a r dt h er e a l i z a t i o no fp r e c i s i o nmedicine., Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank the investigators of the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer, the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and the Connectivity Map teams who have made their invaluable data available to the scientific community., The authors also thank Dr Christos Hatzis and Dr Leming Shifor their insightful discussions regarding the current obstacles in pharmaco- genomics, as well as the reviewers for their constructive comments., Funding This work was supported by the Canadian Cancer Research Society and the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research., D.W. was supported by a CIHR-IG Computational Biology Undergraduate Summer Student Health Research Award., D.M.A.G. was supported by a CIBC-Brain Canada Brain Cancer Research Training Award.

It presents the PharmacoGx package as a solution that enables better integration and analysis of pharmacogenomic datasets. This contrasts with previous research that may not have addressed the need for such standardization or may have accepted the existing inconsistencies without proposing a structured approach to overcome them.\n\n3. **Validation of Drug Sensitivity Associations**: The authors confirm specific gene-drug associations (e.g., BRAF mutation with MEK inhibitor sensitivity) using the updated datasets from GDSC and CCLE. This validation supports the relevance of these datasets despite the previously noted inconsistencies. This could contradict earlier findings that suggested a lack of reliability in these datasets for biomarker discovery.\n\nIn summary, while the paper acknowledges the inconsistencies in drug response data from previous studies, it also demonstrates that known biomarkers can still be reliably identified, which may contradict the notion that these datasets are fundamentally flawed for biomarker discovery. The introduction of the PharmacoGx package also suggests a shift towards a more standardized approach that was not previously emphasized in the literature."
