Introduction Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a cur- rent standard option for the treatment of head and neck cancer (HNC) and often allows effective sparing of organs at risk (OARs)., Dose-painting via IMRT allows deliveryof nonuniform doses to clinical target volumes (CTVs) ofdifferent recurrence risks, thus improving the therapeuticratio., 1In the phase 2 Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0225 trial of IMRT with or without chemotherapy fornasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), intermediate-riskCTV (IR-CTV) was de fined as gross tumor volume (GTV) + 10-mm margin plus areas at risk for microscopic involvement., The recommended coverage for microscopicinvolvement was speci fic and included the entire naso- pharynx, retropharyngeal nodal regions,  skull base,  clivus, pterygoid fossae,  parapharyngeal space, sphenoid sinus, the posterior third of the nasal cavity/maxillary sinuses, and the pterygopalatine fossae., 2The extent of IR-CTV for NPC is related to marginal local recurrences3and devel- opment of radiation toxicity, including xerostomia and swallowing dif ficulty, 4yet interobserver variation in delin- eating IR-CTV can be substantial.5With advancement of conformal radiation therapy (RT) techniques and reduc-tion of target margins, adequate target coverage hasbecome a critical issue, and consensus guidelines fordelineating neck node levels 6and CTVs for conformal RT for nasopharynx and other head and neck tumor sites have been published.7, 8 RT quality assurance (QA) is particularly important for HNC treatment, especially in the conformal RT era, due tothe complexity of RT target volumes and multiple adjacentOARs., 9A retrospective evaluation of protocol compliance in a phase 3 HNC RT trial found that protocol noncompli-ance was associated with a 20% poorer 2-year overall sur-vival (OS), and 25% of major protocol violations were due to incorrect coverage of target volumes., 10Clinical studies rely on assumption and/or maintenance of adequate QAhowever, limitations in time and human resources toreview large patient cohorts often result in complianceissues., Multi-institutional prospective RT trials requirecentral review of RT target delineation, yet only the first few cases are submitted and reviewed for participation inmany trials., 11Patterns-of-RT-practice studies often rely on survey questionnaires12instead of visually inspecting the RT structures, target volumes,  and OARs., To address these issues we first reviewed our peer- reviewed RT-QA data and determined whether the rou-tine clinical QA round was associated with a difference intreatment outcomes., Second we used a cloud-based QA tool ( QUANNOTATE ) to independently evaluate the effect of RT target quality on treatment outcomes., QUAN- NOTATE allows rapid and qualitative review of RT target volumes in an easily accessible format without requiringaccess to the RT planning system ( www.quannotate.com )., Using this tool we evaluated the relationship between tar- get delineation compliance with the published interna- tional guidelines 7and treatment outcomes of patients with NPC undergoing radical RT., Methods and Materials Study population and RT QA data analysis The data set used for this study consisted of 354 patients with pathologically con firmed NPC who under- went IMRT at a tertiary referral cancer center betweenJuly 2005 and August 2017., All of these patients were included in an institutional prospective HNC database in which outcomes are recorded at the point of care 13and had been subject to the standard internal QA processesused at our center., 14All patients were managed with mul- tidisciplinary input according to institutional protocols.Generally, T1-T2 N0 patients received RT alone whileT1-T2 N1 were treated with concurrent chemo-RT (if fit)., More advanced cases were treated with concurrent chemo-RT followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The RT regimen comprised 70 Gy in 35 fractions over 7 weeksusing IMRT with daily image guidance. 15RT target vol- umes were peer-reviewed in a weekly RT QA round andtarget contours were revised, if recommended,  before RTplanning and delivery., Treatment outcome was analyzedwith regards to whether RT target volumes were peer-reviewed and changes in the target contours were made., Cloud-based web application development Among the 354 patients included in the RT QA data analysis digital imaging and communications in medicine(DICOM) or RT structure data of 24 patients were inacces-sible, leaving 332 patients available for the development of our cloud-based web application ( Fig., 1 ). The data set con- sisted of anonymized computed tomography (CT) simula-tion scans RT structures, and the clinical data., Patients  CT images contained a median of 181 slices, with each sliceconsisting of 512 512 pixels. The median slice thicknessPractical Radiation Oncology July/August 2023 Cloud-based quality assurance in RT for NPC e355 was 2.0 mm (range, 2.0-3.0 mm).16The contours of GTV and IR-CTV were extracted from existing RT structure setsof each patient, and a python-based framework was usedto develop the web application ( Fig., E1 ). Details about implementation are provided in Supplementary Methods. This study conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the HealthCanada and Public Health Agency of Canada researchethics board (approval #17-5871)., IR-CTVp delineation compliance assessment Two CTVs for the primary tumor (CTVp) are routinely used for NPC treatment at our institution, High risk CTV(HR-CTVp) was designated as CTV70 and IR-CTVp asCTV56, and these targets correspond to CTVp1 andCTVp2,  respectively, in the international guidelines for thedelineation of the CTV for NPC., 7We loaded GTVp and IR-CTVp into our web application and used binary assess-ments of whether or not 18 anatomic sites were includedwithin IR-CTVp, whole nasopharynx,  posterior nasal cav- ity5 mm from choana, posterior maxillary sinuses from the posterior wall,  right and left foramen ovale, foramenrotundum,  foramen lacerum,  petrous apices,  pterygoid fos-sae,  and parapharyngeal spaces, ipsilateral cavernous sinus(if T3-4),  inferior 1/2 (if T1-2) or whole (if T3-4) sphenoidsinus, and anterior 1/3 (if no invasion) or whole clivus (ifinvasion)., Compliance score was de fined as the number of anatomic sites included within IR-CTVp and a score of 18 would indicate complete inclusion of these anatomic sites., The cloud-based web application can be accessed onlinefrom remote locations. Users are able to slide through anentire CT scan of a patient and review the CTV contourssuperimposed to the CT images., Blinded to the treatmentoutcomes a radiation oncologist (JK) with 10 years of Figure 1 Study inclusion work flow.e356 J.W., Kim et al Practical Radiation Oncology July/August 2023 posttraining experience determined inclusion of the ana- tomic sites within IR-CTVp, and the results were exported to be analyzed after complete assessment., Interpretation of international guidelines Controversial issues may arise during the implementation of international guidelines in de fining target volumes., For example the expert group in cluding key oncologists from A s i a( C h i n a , H o n gK o n g , K o r e a , S i n g a p o r e , T a i w a n ) , A u s -tralia,  North America (Canada, U nited States),  Saudi Arabia,  and Europe (Belgium,  Denmark,  France,  The Netherlands,  Turkey, United Kingdom) showed low (65%) consensus onw h e t h e ro rn o tt os h a v eo u ta i rc a v i t i e sw i t h i nt h eH R - / I R -CTVp volumes for NPC., 7The guidelines recommend cover- age of the ipsilateral cavernous sinus for T3-4 tumors yetsome advanced tumors may not have clear invasion of thecavernous sinus or de finite lateralization., Coverage of the petrous tip is recommended for all stages yet the extent of adequate coverage for the petrous apex is not clear., We defined additional criteria to help determine guideline com- pliance shaving of air cavity was not allowed for sphenoidsinus but for nasal cavity and maxillary sinuses, both cavern-ous sinuses should be covered in case invasion or laterality isunclear for T3-4 tumors, unless T4-category is solely relatedto inferior extension such as to the hypopharynx, and at leastanterior 1/2 of the anterior petrous apex bounded by internal auditory canal should be covered in all stages ( Table 1 )., Statistical analysis The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate OS and time to local failure (TTLF), and the log-rank test wasused to provide a statistical comparison of 2 groups., Sur-vival was calculated from the start of RT to death due to any cause or last patient follow-up and TTLF from the start of RT to a pathologically con firmed local failure or clear radiographic progression in cases where biopsy wasnot indicated., Factors with Pvalues <.10 in univariable analysis (UVA) were evaluated for independence with theCox proportional hazards model., We analyzed treatmentoutcomes of the whole cohort whereas a subgroup T3-4cases were analyzed when guidelines provided separate recommendations for locally advanced diseases., Data analysis was performed with SPSS Statistics, version 25.0(IBM, Armonk, NY). Results We reviewed our RT-QA data which was conducted to determine whether the routine clinical QA round wasassociated with a difference in treatment outcomes., Sub-sequently we developed a new, cloud-based QA tool thatallowed rapid and qualitative review of RT target volumes and evaluated the relationship between target delineation compliance with the published international guidelines and treatment outcomes of patients with NPC undergoingradical RT., The study work flow and the development pro- cess of the cloud-based web application are presented inFigs., 1 andE1, respectively. Effect of RT QA rounds on treatment outcomes Among the 354 patients RT target volumes of 210 patients were peer-reviewed at weekly QA rounds, andthe clinical characteristics of peer-reviewed and nonre-viewed patients are compared in Table E1 ., Peer-reviewed patients were associated with shorter smoking history (P= .016) and a higher proportion of nondrinkers (P= .012) and showed a tendency toward higher ( IVA- B) clinical stages ( P= .068)., The 5-year local control (LC 91% vs 95%,  P= .101),  distant metastasis (DC,  85% vs 86%,  P= .586), and OS (85% vs 85%, P= .946) rates were similar between the peer-reviewed and nonreviewed cases(Fig., E2A-C ). Among the 210 peer-reviewed cases RT target contours of 55 cases were revised as recommended by peer reviewers., Although the 5-year LC rates (90% vs91% P= .813) were similar between the cases with and without target contour changes,  DC (79% vs 87%, P= .068) and OS rates (78% vs 87%, P= .069) were lower for the cases with changes in the target contours, althoughthe difference was not statistically signi ficant ( P>.05,  Fig., E2D-F ). Compliance of IR-CTVp with international guidelines Clinical characteristics of 332 patients with NPC are summarized in Table 2 ., The median age was 52 years. T3- 4 tumors were diagnosed in 59.3% and cervical lymphnode metastasis in 87.3% of the patients. Concurrent che-moradiation was the predominant treatment modality(87.7%) with a median total RT dose of 70.0 Gy ( Table 2 )., For all patients (n = 332) the number of cases with each anatomic site missed by IR-CTVp were as follows, 1 (0.3%) for whole nasopharynx,  2 (0.6%) for posteriornasal cavity, 2 (0.6%) for posterior maxillary sinuses,  6(1.8%) and 4 (1.2%) for right and left foramen ovale, 14(4.2%) and 12 (3.6%) for right and left foramen rotun-dum, 1 (0.3%) and 3 (0.9%) for right and left foramen lac-erum, 0 and 1 (0.3%) for right and left pterygoid fossa, 0and 1 (0.3%) for right and left parapharyngeal space,  and 14 (4.2%) for the clivus., Right and left apices of the petrous bone were inadequately contoured in 32 (9.2%)and 37 (11.1%) cases, respectively,  while the majority ofinadequate coverage was observed in T1-2 cases., Inade-quate contouring of sphenoid sinus was observed in 59Practical Radiation Oncology July/August 2023 Cloud-based quality assurance in RT for NPC e357 (29.9%) of the T3-4 cases and 10 (7.4%) of the T1-2 cases., Contouring of cavernous sinus was recommended only for T3-4 tumors and 38 of the 197 cases (19.3%) wereinadequately covered ( Fig., 2 A). Patterns of failure At a median follow-up of 5.6 years (range 0.1-13.8), treatment resulted in 13 (3.9%) local,  3 (0.9%) regional, 37 distant (11.1%), 7 (2.1%) locoregional,  2 (0.6%) localand distant,  9 (2.7%) regional and distant, and 1 (0.3%)locoregional and distant failures ( Fig., E3 ). The ratio of nonguideline contoured anatomic sites among 23 local failures to those among all patients was highest for left (1/ 4) and right (1/6) foramen ovale, followed by cavernoussinus (7/38),  clivus (2/14),  sphenoid sinus (8/69), left (4/37) and right (3/32) petrous apices, and left (1/12) andright (1/14) foramen rotundum ( Fig., 2 B). The compliancescore and number of local failures for each of the scores are shown in Fig. E4 . Score of 16 or higher was achieved in 93.9% of the cases and local failure rates increasedfrom 5.4% for a score of 18 to 20.0% for a score of 15., Survival analysis T4 disease ( P= .006) and undercontouring of the cav- ernous sinus ( P=. 0 1 3 )s h o w e das i g n i ficant correlation with decreased TTLF and treatment with RT alone(P= .084) showed a marginal correlation in UVA, while these variables all proved to be independent prognostic fac-tors in multivariable analysis (MVA) ( Table 3 )., A similar trend was observed in a subgroup of T3-4 cases (n = 197) albeit cavernous sinus undercontouring ( P= .072) was less prognostic for TTLF than T4 ( P=., 0 0 8 )a n dR Ta l o n e (P= .049) in MVA ( Table E2 ).

Kim et al Practical Radiation Oncology July/August 2023 application was not associat ed with improved outcomes,  however, undercovering the cavernous sinus was associated with higher local failure on UVA and MVA., Multi-institutional clinical trials involving modern RT techniques are unique in that treatment quality can beassessed by reviewing digitized medical images and associ-ated RT structures., 17 18Ng et al19showed that when the volume within GTVp <66.5 Gy (95% prescribed dose) was greater than the cutoff volume of 3.4 cm3, the 5-year local failure-free survival decreased from 90% to 54%., This sug- gests that survival as function of target coverage,  is highlynonlinear, where even a small cold spot (ie, 3.4 cm 3 implies sphere of radius 0.93 cm) can have an enormous effect (ie, 40% reduction in survival from 90%-54%)., MVAby Ng et al showed that underdosing was an independentpredictor of local failure disease free survival,  and OS., In the modern conformal RT era QA of large-scale trials is challenging because of time-consuming processes for col-lecting and reviewing hundreds or thousands of individualcases and dif ficulty in eliminating interobserver variability among reviewers., We developed QUANNOTATE a cloud- based web application for rapid review of hundreds orthousands of NPC cases (and other primary sites)., QUAN- NOTATE provides a QA platform for uploading CT simu- lation images and RT structures and allows rapid and qualitative review of target volumes with respect to pub-lished guidelines in an easily accessible format., With a median follow-up of 5.6 years in the current study the local recurrence rate of 6.9% for NPC is compa-rable with previously published IMRT data., 20 21Table 3 Prognostic factors for time to local failure (n = 332) Variable No.Univariate analysis Multivariate analysis HR 95% CI P HR 95% CI P Age >53 157 2.00 0.87-4.64 .10 53 175 1 Sex Female 94 1.59 0.69-3.67 .290 Male 238 1 Performance ECOG 1 96 1.61 0.68-3.81 .28 ECOG 0 236 1 Smoking Hx Yes/unknown 143 0.78 0.33-1.84 .57 None 189 1 Alcohol Hx Yes/unknown 102 1.1 0.43-2.81 .84 None 230 1 EBV Negative 91 0.81 0.31-2.10 .669 Positive 241 1 Pathology WHO I/IIa 66 0.96 0.33-2.78 .937 WHO IIb 266 1 T stage T4 92 3.15 1.39-7.14 .006 4.02 1.63-9.94 .003 T3 240 1 1 Treatment RT alone 41 2.4 0.89-6.48 .084 4.50 1.50-13.5 .007 CCRT 291 1 1 Compliance <18 127 1.91 0.84-4.35 .13 18 205 1 Petrous apex Nonconforming 48 1.51 0.56-4.1 .41 Conforming 284 1 Cavernous sinus Nonconforming 38 3.07 1.26-7.48 .013 2.92 1.19-7.19 .020 Conforming 294 1 1 Sphenoid sinus Nonconforming 69 2.04 0.87-4.82 .10 Conforming 263 1 Abbreviations, CCRT = concurrent chemoradiation,  CI = con fidence interval,  EBV = Epstein-Barr virus, ECOG = Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group,  HR = hazard ratio,  Hx = history, RT = radiation therapy,  WHO = World Health Organization.Practical Radiation Oncology, July/August 2023 Cloud-based quality assurance in RT for NPC e361 Nevertheless, inadequate coverage of the cavernous sinus was observed in 19.3% of T3-4 cases and was an indepen- dent prognostic factor for TTLF., The importance ofincluding the cavernous sinus within IR-CTVp was notuniversally recognized Among the 6 studies reviewed bythe international guidelines committee, 7coverage of the cavernous sinus was not stated in 2 studies, RadiationTherapy Oncology Group 0225 2and the Chinese guide- lines.22The recommendation to include the involved-side cavernous sinus for T3-4 tumor was based on the findings by Liang et al, 23where the cumulative incidence rate of cavernous sinus invasion was 17.4%,  however, the struc-ture was only at high risk when the tumor in filtrated the petrous apex or the foramen lacerum., Liang et al sug-gested that local disease tends to spread stepwise fromproximal site to more distal sites, thus covering cavernoussinus is necessary for T3-4 tumors., Our data support the international guidelines recommendations on the cover- age of the cavernous sinus for T3-4 tumors., High localfailure rates associated with inadequate coverage of otheranatomic sites including foramen ovale and sphenoidsinus,  suggest that,  with a larger study cohort, we may beable to rank these anatomic sites in order of importance in delineating target volumes., Imaging biomarker studies are rapidly gaining popu- larity. Radiomics studies extract features from a large number of radiologic medical images using diversecomputational approaches., 24-26Although measures are taken to ensure reproducibility of the results via standard-izing processes of image acquisition and data analysis, 27, 28 the effect of treatment quality is often overlooked in radiomics studies, potentially confounding the search forrobust biomarkers., With respect to optimizing plans standardizing treatment to follow known, accepted inter- national guidelines minimizes variance., These changesare low hanging fruit and arguably,  the simplest, most effective change one can do to improve treatment out-comes., If a chemotherapy agent demonstrated acomparable positive effect as rigorous treatment QA it would have been adopted without question., Our results suggest that radiomics analysis of published data setsshould be preceded by detailed QA analysis to ensure out-comes are not confounded because of variance in treat-ment-related factors as opposed to tumor factors., Thistool could also be used as a measure for treatment qualitybut in a more general sense. For example the proportionof plans that conform within the guidelines could be used as a quality metric at the level of the individual, site group,  department,  or even institution., Our cloud-based application i s not well suited for review- ing a small number of cases in cl inical rounds, during which participants can easily ac cess an RT planning system to review individual cases in deta il., The design of our applica- tion in the current form is better suited for reviewing a largenumber of cases among multidisciplinary teams or multi- institutional trial groups ., The presentation format of QUAN- NOTATE can be modi fied according to the objectives of its application, and we can suggest several areas where use ofQUANNOTATE can be bene ficial., First the target delinea- tion QA platform can readily be used for assessment of ana-tomic understanding and pathway of tumor spread and canbe an effective tool for teachi ng and assessing medical stu- dents and radiation oncology r esidents., Second RT planning studies often review and correlate radiation dose distribution with treatment outcomes., Dose distribution data stored inRT planning stations can readily be transported ontoQUANNOTATE a n dr e v i e w e dw i t hc o r r e s p o n d i n gR Tt a r g e t volumes., Third upgraded wit h additional viewing windows and a toggle switch for image selection, QUANNOTATE can be used to compare regions of i nterest between serially taken images, and this can be an effective tool for evaluating treat- ment responses in studies with l a r g es a m p l es i z e s .O u rg o a l is to implement arti ficial intelligence-based image recogni- tion in the QUANNOTATE platform, and this will reduce time consumption and interobs erver variability and open doors to many more applications., Figure 3 Kaplan-Meier curves for (A) time to local failure and (B) overall survival by cavernous sinus conformity.e362 J.W., Kim et al Practical Radiation Oncology July/August 2023 This study is subject to the limitations of all retrospec- tive and single-institution studies, such as selection bias,  small number of events,  and observer bias., The results of the current study were derived from a largely endemic pop-ulation that did not undergo induction chemotherapy., Wefocused on the compliance of IR-CTVp with the interna-tional guidelines thus the outcome of interest was mainlylocal failure., The NPC cases imported into QUANNO- TATE include the cases whose target contours had been revised per recommendation during internal QA rounds., With high compliance of target volumes and a small num- ber of events (23 local failures) we lacked power to exam-ine the signi ficance of other anatomic sites., The analysis of local failure sites in relation to anatomic structures andradiation dose distribution is not included in the currentstudy because of the close proximity of the anatomic struc-tures reviewed for protocol compliance and lack of dosedistribution data., In accordance with the study by Liang et al 231 of 4 to 6 (17%-25%) cases with inadequate coverage of foramen ovale resulted in local failures in the currentstudy., A validation study with a large external cohortwould increase the power to examine the effect of underco-verage of other anatomic sites., Second compliance of IR-CTVp with the international guidelines was reviewed byonly 1 experienced radiation oncologist., We implementedadditional criteria of compliance to minimize observer bias by the reviewer. A validation study with an external cohort and interobserver variation analysis is underway. Conclusion We developed a web-based QA tool for qualitative review of target volumes for a large NPC cohort., Although targetvolumes of the study cohort showed high compliance withthe international guidelines QUANNOTATE identi fied inadequate coverage of the cavernous sinus as correlatedwith local failure, in agreement with the guidelines., Supplementary materials Supplementary material associated with this article can be found in the online version at doi, 10.1016/j., prro.2023.03.003 .

      "question": "What are the key findings of the paper?",
      "answer": "The key findings of the paper titled \"Effect of Radiation Therapy Quality Assurance on Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Usage of a Novel, Web-Based Quality Assurance Application\" are as follows:\n\n1. **Development of QUANNOTATE**: The study introduced a cloud-based web application called QUANNOTATE, designed for rapid and qualitative review of radiation therapy (RT) target volumes, specifically for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).\n\n2. **Compliance with International Guidelines**: The analysis of 332 patients showed high compliance with international guidelines for delineating intermediate-risk clinical target volumes (CTVp). However, specific anatomic sites, particularly the cavernous sinus and sphenoid sinus, were frequently undercovered.\n\n3. **Correlation with Treatment Outcomes**: The study found that inadequate coverage of the cavernous sinus was significantly correlated with higher rates of local failure (time to local failure, TTLF). Specifically, patients with compliant coverage of the cavernous sinus had a 5-year TTLF of 93.6%, compared to 89.1% for noncompliant cases (P= .013).\n\n4. **Peer Review Impact**: The peer-review process for RT target volumes did not show a significant difference in local control, distant control, or overall survival rates between reviewed and non-reviewed cases. However, cases with revised target contours had lower distant control and overall survival rates, suggesting that revisions may reflect more aggressive disease characteristics rather than improved outcomes.\n\n5. **Local Failure Patterns**: Among the 23 patients who experienced local failure, the majority had noncompliant coverage of critical anatomic sites, including the cavernous sinus and sphenoid sinus, indicating that these areas are crucial for effective treatment planning.\n\n6. **Prognostic Factors**: Multivariable analysis identified T4 disease and noncompliance with cavernous sinus coverage as independent prognostic factors for TTLF, highlighting the importance of adhering to guidelines for optimal treatment outcomes.\n\n7. **Long-Term Follow-Up**: The study reported a median follow-up of 5.6 years, with 5-year TTLF and overall survival rates of 93.1% and 85.9%, respectively, for the entire cohort.\n\nIn conclusion, the study emphasizes the importance of quality assurance in radiation therapy for NPC, particularly the need for adherence to international guidelines for target volume delineation to improve patient outcomes. The QUANNOTATE application serves as a valuable tool for enhancing the quality of RT planning and compliance assessment."

      "question": "Are there any contradictions between this paper's findings and previous research?",
      "answer": "Based on the content of the research paper, there are some findings that may present contradictions or differing interpretations compared to previous research. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Cavernous Sinus Coverage**: The paper emphasizes that inadequate coverage of the cavernous sinus was correlated with higher local failure rates, particularly in T3-4 tumors. This finding supports the international guidelines recommending coverage of the cavernous sinus for T3-4 tumors. However, it contrasts with some previous studies and guidelines that did not universally recognize the necessity of including the cavernous sinus in treatment plans for all T3-4 cases. For instance, the paper mentions that in two studies reviewed by the international guidelines committee, coverage of the cavernous sinus was not stated, suggesting a lack of consensus in the literature regarding its importance.\n\n2. **Peer Review Impact on Outcomes**: The study found that peer-reviewed cases did not show statistically significant differences in local control, distant metastasis, or overall survival rates compared to non-reviewed cases. This finding may contradict previous research that indicated peer review and quality assurance processes could lead to improved treatment outcomes. For example, earlier studies have shown that protocol noncompliance was associated with poorer survival rates, suggesting that rigorous quality assurance could be beneficial.\n\n3. **Compliance with International Guidelines**: The paper reports high compliance with international guidelines for target volume delineation, yet it identifies specific anatomic sites (like the cavernous sinus and sphenoid sinus) where noncompliance was prevalent. This highlights a potential gap between guideline recommendations and actual clinical practice, which may not have been as pronounced in earlier studies that did not focus on such detailed compliance assessments.\n\n4. **Local Failure Rates**: The reported local failure rate of 6.9% is comparable to previously published data on IMRT for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However, the paper suggests that even small deviations in target coverage can significantly impact local failure rates, which may not have been emphasized in earlier studies.
