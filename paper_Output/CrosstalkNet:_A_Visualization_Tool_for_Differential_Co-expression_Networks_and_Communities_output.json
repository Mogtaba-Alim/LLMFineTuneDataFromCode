Introduction Co-expression networks are a representation of putative gene  gene relationships built by investigating the similarity of tran- scriptomic pro files across samples., During the last decade co-expression networks have grown in popularity as they enable the integration of large-scale transcriptomic datasets, allowing identi fication and exploration of multiple genes with similar expression patterns across conditions (1 6)., Given the relevance of these co-expression networks in cancer research we developed CrosstalkNet , a web-based tool that enable users to explore and mine co-expression networks., We present here an application of CrosstalkNet in the context of tumor epithelial-stromal cross-talk, although the tool is widely applicable to the analysis of bipartite networks in general., One of the most important signaling networks in tumor biology is the communication between tumor epithelial (epi) cells and neighboring stromal cells (7), which is mediated through regula- tory loops between compartments., A promising approach to shed light on such a cellular cross-talk lies in using the transcriptionalprofiles of epithelial and stromal sample pairs obtained from laser capture micro-dissection (Supplementary Fig., S1) to construct co- expression networks (3). Given the computational and biological complexity of the co-expressionnetwork it is challenging to explore and comprehend these large-scale networks., Epi stromal co- expression networks can be represented as a bipartite network where each node represents a gene and each edge denotes a co- expression relationship between the epithelium and stroma (Fig., 1A). Differential networks have recently been used to charac- terize the rewiring of condition-speci fic interactions (8)., We present here the first application of this methodology in the context of epi  stroma cross-talk to uncover the differential interactions gained and lost by tumor (Supplementary Fig., S2). Most common visualization tool is Cytoscape but, BiLayout is the only layout in Cytoscape that allows for visualizing bipartite networks., However it requires manually selecting the nodes of interest as well as the neighbors to be plotted., In addition, it is difficult to visualize second neighbors. CrosstalkNet overcome the limitations the existing web-based visualization tools (Supplemen- tary Information) to better explore large-scale bipartite networks (see Supplementary Video S1)., We believe that this web-based application will assist researchers across disciplines in mining bipar- tite biological co-expression networks, as exempli fied by our study of the epithelial stromal cross-talk that occurs in breast tumors., Network Inference The datasets used in this study are presented in the Supple- mentary Table S1. The genome-wide tumor epi stroma network was constructed by estimating pairwise co-expression using Pear- son's correlation coef ficient between the tumor epithelium and tumor stroma, whereas the normal network was constructed using the same approach based on normal epithelium and normal stroma., Each node represents a gene and co-expressions between gene iin the epi cells with gene igene j, gene kin the stromal cells are represented by edges,  as seen in Fig., 1A and Supplementary1Princess Margaret Cancer Centre University Health Network,  Toronto,  Ontario, Canada.2Department of Medical Biophysics,  University of Toronto,  Toronto,  Ontario, Canada.3Goodman Cancer Research Centre,  McGill University,  Montreal, Canada.4Department of Computer Science,  University of Toronto,  Toronto,  Ontario, Canada.5Ontario Institute of Cancer Research,  Toronto,  Ontario,  Canada., Note Supplementary data for this article are available at Cancer Research Online (http, //cancerres.aacrjournals.org/)., V.

This approach is extended by statistically comparing the interactions inferred from tumor and matched normal samples (8) and are applied here for the first time to infer epi stroma networks (Supplementary Information)., Software Architecture CrosstalkNet uses a node.js server that interacts with Rscript to execute user queries., Rscripts are responsible for interacting with the bipartite network files and determining neighbors and paths in those networks., Communication between node.js and Rscript happens via JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). Once the net-work files have been accessed the results are sent back to the user and displayed via cytoscape.js, which is embedded in an Angu- larJS and Angular Material front-end., Features CrosstalkNet is divided into five major panels namely,  Main Graph,  Interaction Explorer, Path Explorer,  Degree Explorer,  Community Explorer (Fig., 1B). Each panel has its own modular work flow, and is shown in Fig. 1C. The functionalities of the panels are described below in detail. Case studies will be further presented to exemplify the use of each of the panels in the Supplementary Material., Figure 1. CrosstalkNet web-application.

Uploaded files must have an Rdata extension and must contain a single dgCMatrix (sparse matrix) from the Matrix package saved using the saveRDS function., Furthermore row names and column names have to match, and thefile must not contain missing (NA) values., In addition, row and column names and either be gene symbols or entrez gene identi fiers. Uploaded files will be private to the user that uploaded them and cannot be accessed by other users and can be deleted at anytime., Main graph. The Main Graph is used to view the first and second neighbors of multiple genes of interest at the same time (See Supplementary Video S2)., To prevent graphs from getting unman- ageably large in size a filtering option is provided in order to allow filtering of both first and second neighbors individually., This makes it possible to focus on the more relevant interactions. There is a table view showing the interactions between the genes in the corresponding graph and the table is downloadable as a comma- separated value (CSV) file., Interaction explorer. The interaction explorer enables this func- tionality by providing the ability to view arbitrarily many levels of neighbors (See Supplementary Video S3)., Path explorer. The path explorer makes it possible to obtain all paths with a maximum of one hop between two genes of interest (See Supplementary Video S4)., Degree explorer. The degree explorer displays either the top genes based on their degree or by showing genes having a degree greater or equal to a speci fied number, or using both the options (See Supplementary Video S5)., It is capable of showing an arbitrarily large list of genes which can be downloaded in a simple CSV format., Community explorer. Communities of interactors hold the poten- tial to reveal functional processes of a biological system., The community explorer functionality allows the user to upload communities of the co-expression network using their favorite community detection algorithms, visualize them as seen in Fig., 1D, and can be downloaded in a CSV format. See Supplementary Video S6 for a detailed tutorial. Availability of data and material Documentation along with a video tutorial for the web- application are provided within the tool (http, //crosstalknet., pmgenomics.ca/app/#/documentation). The examples used in the web application namely,  normal, tumor and differential epi- stroma networks can be downloaded directly from the tool., These examples are provided to guest users as well as registered users. The methodology used to construct differential network as well as the web-based tool can be used to mine networks based on pan cancer transcriptomic pro files., The code is open-source and freely available from GitHub (github.com/bhklab/CrosstalkNet/). Results In this study we show how the CrosstalkNet web-application can be used to uncover the epi stroma co-dependencies in ER breast cancer patients., The details of the network topology areprovided in the Supplementary Text. The degree distributions of epi stroma genes in the tumor network is presented in Supple- mentary Fig., S4A and S4B, respectively. The number of interac- tions with respect to their signi ficance ( Pvalue) is provided in Supplementary Fig., S5. We used a false discovery rate (FDR) of 15% to select the set of signi ficant interactions. Concordant with our previous work (3) we found that the proportion of self-loops to be signi ficantly higher in tumor compared to normal (Supple- mentary Fig., S6). CrosstalkNet enables (i) ef ficient exploration of a shared neighborhood ( first neighbors) of genes of interest (Sup- plementary Fig., S7A); (ii) exploration of paracrine interactions (Supplementary Fig. S7B) (iii) identi fication of paths between any functionally similar genes (Supplementary Table S2), and (iv) identi fication of hubs as potential drug targets (Supplementary Table S3)., We show hereafter how CrosstalkNet enables ef ficient exploration of gene interactions through two case studies describ- ing how to mine a differential network, and extract the commu- nity structure from the tumor network., Identi fication of gain/loss of interactions in the differential network To identify the epi stroma interactions that are gained or lost in ERbreast tumors, we used the Delta option in the main graph panel to explore a differential network., With the tumor- speci fice p istroma (differential) network selected we explored the interactions involving S100A7 , ap r o t e i ni nt h eS 1 0 0f a m i l y known to be a key contributor to the onset of aggressive and invasive tumors with the help of the tumor stroma (9)., We identi fied a large change in the co-expression of S100A7 -epi and S100A7 -stroma between normal and tumor networks ( D14 0.99, Supplementary Fig., S7C), indicating that there is a strong gain of interaction in the tumor. This supports the fact that S100A7 is one of the key genes that is differentially co-expressed between normal epi-stroma and tumor epi stroma, and con- tributes to tumorigenesis (9)., Identi fication of communities of interactors Biological networks are known to have speci fic topology and structure, consisting of nodes that interact with each other and govern speci fic cellular processes., These groups of nodes are termed a community in the biological network. We used the CONDOR method (10) to obtain communities in the tumor epi  stroma interaction network resulting in 62 communities, which can be displayed using the Community Explorer (Supplementary Fig., S8A). Each community consists of both epi genes and stroma genes (Supplementary Fig. S8B). We then performed a pathway analysis on all the communities that have /C215 using all the genes with Gene Ontology terms (11)., A total of 705 pathways are overrepresented with an FDR <5% (Supplementary Fig. S8C). Broadly the enriched GO terms belong to cell cycle,  DNA synthesis and integrity,  metabolism, etc.,  which are known to regulate tumor progression, resistance in ERbreast cancer patients (12 14)., Conclusions The availability of high-throughput data along with the advancement of web-based technologies has led to the develop- ment of network visualization tools to mine large-scale interac- tion graphs., We developed CrosstalkNet a user-friendly web- application that can be used to explore and mine interactions.Manem et al., Cancer Res 78(8) April 15,  2018 Cancer Research 2142Downloaded from http, //aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-pdf/78/8/2140/2777602/2140.pdf by University Health Network user on 20 November 2023 The application gives users the ability to upload their customized files and, to search and highlight a gene of interest in a dense network, along with multiple layout options., Users can also explore their inferred bipartite networks by focusing on a speci fic subgraph filtering the network based on interaction strength, investigating the possible paths between two genes, identifying the hubs along with identi fication of communities in the network., In the present study we have described the use of CrosstalkNet with biologically relevant case studies reporting relevant epistroma interactions in ERbreast cancer., We showed how to mine interactions in differential co-expression networks and how to extract the community structure from the epi stroma interaction networks., Overall our case studies highlight the importance of differential networks and community structure in a biologically meaningful way., Moreover these case studies (including the ones in Supplemen tary Information) reiterate the relevance and versatility of the CrosstalkNet web-application in cancer research., In conclusion we developed CrosstalkNet , a web-application enabling exploratory network analysis for researchers without requiring computational skills., CrosstalkNet will assist researchers across various disciplines along with the clinicians in mining complex networks to decipher novel biological processes in thetumor epithelial stroma cross-talk, as well as in other studies of intercompartmental interactions., Disclosure of Potential Con flicts of Interest No potential con flicts of interest were disclosed.
