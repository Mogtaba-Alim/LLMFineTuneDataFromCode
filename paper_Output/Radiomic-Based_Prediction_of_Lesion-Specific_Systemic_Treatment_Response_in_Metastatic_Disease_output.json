The effect of LM volume was controlled by removing radiomic features at a volume-correlation coefficient threshold of 0.20., Predicting lesion-specific responses using radiomic features represents a novel strategy by which to assess treatment response that acknowledges biological diversity within metastatic subclones, which could facilitate management strategies involving selective ablation of resistant clones in the setting of systemic therapy., Keywords/Phrases  Computed tomography  Treatment response prediction  Radiomics  Sarcoma  Metastasis ., CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity., (which was not certified by peer review)The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted October 13, 2023. ,  https, //doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.22.23294942doi, medRxiv preprint Introduction Cancer is a dynamic disease characterized by the development of rapidly-dividing abnormal cells and is a leading cause of death worldwide [1]., As cancer develops subpopulations of cells emerge with distinct genotypes and phenotypes, harboring divergent biological behaviors [2]., The net result is increased cancer heterogeneity over time individual patients,  lesions, and cell populations with varying sensitivities to anticancer therapies[3]., Cancer heterogeneity as such is associated with inferior clinical outcomes. In this study we focus on inter-metastatic heterogeneity which refers to the heterogeneity among different metastatic lesions of the same primary tumor., Widespread metastases are the primary cause of death in cancer patients[4]. The vast majority of patients with solid tumors die because of metastasis to the liver brain,  lung, or bone., Patients who relapse with a single metastatic lesion can occasionally be cured by surgery or radiotherapy, but single metastases are the exception rather than the rule [5],  [6]., Unfortunately, metastatic sites develop unique phenotypes and genotypes [7], [8]. As such eradicating a subset of metastatic lesions in a patient is not likely to provide adequate long-term disease control., From that perspective identif ying treatment resistant tumors may facilitate combination therapies to provide a more successful treatment outcome [5]., Radiological imaging has a critical role in cancer diagnosis and in evaluating treatment resistant tumors., In particular radiomics has garnered much attention from the research community for its potential predictive power for treatment outcomes and cancer genetics [9], [10]., Radiomics has become an active field of research allowing scientists to extract quantitative features from readily-available radiological images and assess their potential as non-invasive biomarkers [9], [10]., These features can provide information about intensity shape,  volume, and texture of tumor phenotypes [11][14]., In this study we investigate the utility of radiomic-based biomarkers for prediction of lesion-level systemic treatment response, which could help to get a more comprehensive view on the overall patient status., This type of response prediction has been recently initiated within the context of imaging studies. Correlation between computed tomography (CT) textural features with pathological features and clinical outcome has been demonstrated in liver metastases [15], [16]., More recently lesion level immunotherapy response prediction using image-derived or radiomic features has been explored across a range of metastatic sites with promising results [17], [18]., To the best of the authors knowledge however there hasn't yet been a successful implementation of a predictive model that can accurately predict the response of individual lesions to standard systemic treatments for metastatic patients., Soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are cancers of connective and supportive tissues in the body they are rare,  heterogeneous,  and notoriously difficult to manage clinically., Patients presenting with locally advanced or metastatic disease have dramatically lower rates of survival than those with non-advanced localized disease [19][21]., In particular leiomyosarcoma (LMS),  one of the more common STS subtypes, tend to be biologically aggressive tumors with high metastatic potential and local recurrence rates, as a result, systemic therapy plays an important role in the multimodality treatment strategy [22]., Radiologic assessment of therapeutic efficacy then becomes a crucial task so that ineffective therapies can be switched out for alternative and potentially more active regimens., Radiomic features are particularly well-suited to interrogating .

A total of 640 patients were enrolled; the primary endpoint of the trial was overall survival. Contrast-enhanced CT obtained prior to treatment and after 2 cycles of systemic therapy were available for analysis in 180 leiomyosarcoma (LMS) patients., Image Segmentation A database of serial CT imaging was obtained from the Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration (SARC)., Chest CT images at two time points (baseline/prior to treatment and after 2 cycles of systemic therapy/at follow-up) were uploaded into the open-source software 3D Slicer ( https, //www.slicer.org/ )., All lung lesions which were identifiable on CT were segmented and subsequently reviewed by a radiologist with 10 years of experience., Lesions were considered identifiable if they were measurable at baseline as defined in RECIST 1.1 (minimum diameter of 10mm in the longest plane of measurement [25]) and confidently located at the second time point., Further lesions that could not be accurately discriminated from surrounding tissues (ie, lung nodule adjacent or within atelectasis) or from other adjacent lesions at baseline or follow-up CTs (i.e., confluent metastases) were not delineated and excluded., Morphological Image Processing Imaging data and lesion segmentations were resampled to a common 1 /i2 /i21 /i2 /i21 mm3 voxel size using bi-linear and nearest neighbor interpolation, respectively., The original lesion segmentation denoting the lesion boundaries was analyzed as the intratumoral region (whole lesion)., From this intratumoral mask an additional three segmentations containing sub-volumes of interest were generated using standard morphological processing ( Figure 1 ), the lesion core and internal and external rims., A ball-shaped structuring element with a radius spatially equivalent to 2 mm, was used to perform the morphological operations., .

The intratumoral mask was eroded to isotropically contract the lesion boundary the remaining voxels in the mask were an alyzed as the lesion core., Voxels in the lesion core were eliminated from the intratumoral mask leaving a mask containing a ring of lesion analyzed as the internal peritumoral region or internal rim., The intratumoral mask was dilated to isotropically expa nd the lesion boundary. Voxels included in the original intratumoral mask were eliminated from the dilated mask leaving a mask containing a ring of lung parenchyma analyzed as the external peritumoral region or external rim., Radiomic Feature Extraction Radiomic features were extracted per the process championed by the Imaging Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI) [13], which is implemented with the open- source software package PyRadiomics (version 3.0.1) [12]., For each lesion and corresponding sub- volumes of interest a total of 1648 features were calculated, features include first- order statistical measures,  histogram,  shape and size descriptions, Grey Level Co- occurrence Matrix (GLCM),  Grey Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM), Grey Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM) and Neighboring Grey Tone Difference Matrix (NGTDM) features., Data Analysis Response Categorization A lesion-wise evaluation of relative change in volume between baseline and follow- up was performed using PyRadiomics (version 3.0.1), the shape descriptive radiomic feature VoxelVolume of the intratumoral mask defined the lesion volume at baseline and after 2 cycles of systemic therapy, respectively., Population- specific outliers were removed using a median absolute deviation outlier detection method, based on the lesion volume at baseline [26] ., Percent change in volume with respect to b aseline was evaluated as a metric of treatment response. A response threshold T r, was defined such that lesions that experienced a positive volume change greater than T r were labeled as progressive, all other lesions were labeled as non-progressive., tic ng ed al he he al er re of al ), nd as re es an . nt ve as .

Five models were tested in total for each arm one model with baseline volume only, one model with baseline volume plus one selected radiomic feature,  and so on., To account for any potential class imbalance between response categories we employed a stratified 10-fold cross validation to fit the data for each modeling strategy using sklearns RepeatedStratifiedKFold [31]., This procedure splits the dataset in such a way that preserves the same class distribution (i.e. the same percentage of sample of each class, in our case progressive and non-progressive lesions) in each subset/fold as in the original dataset., However a single run of StratifiedKFold might result in a noisy estimate of the model's performance, as different splits of the data might result in very different results., As its name suggests RepeatedStratifiedKFold allows improving the estimated performance of a machine learning model, by simply repeating the cross-validation procedure multiple times (according to the n_repeats value, which was set to 5 for this study),  and reporting the mean result across all folds from all runs., This mean result is expected to be a more accurate estimate of the model's performance. The best performing model was defined as the model which minimized the negative log likelihood. Model performance was quantified using Area Under the Curve for the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) and Precision-Recall (AUPRC) curves as well as the evaluation of Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC) [32][34]., A paired Wilcox test was used to test for differences in performance distribution for the model with volume alone versus the best performing model., Sensitivity Analysis The response prediction task was repeated for an additional two subgroups. A median absolute deviation (MAD) outlier detection method was applied to identify population-specific outliers, based on the lesion volume at baseline [26]., The first subgroup was isolated by removing the population-specific outliers and the second subgroup consisted of the outliers themselves., For the latter case where smaller sample sizes are expectedly smaller fewer folds were considered for the cross-validation, on the condition that each train/test group of data samples was ., CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity., (which was not certified by peer review)The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted October 13, 2023. ,  https, //doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.22.23294942doi, medRxiv preprint representative of the broader dataset., A modified Z-score calculated using MAD is considered a robust measure to identify outliers. It replaces standard deviation or variance with median deviation and the mean with the median. The result is a method that isnt as affected by outliers as using the mean and standard deviation. Lesions were considered outliers if their absolute modified Z-score was greater than 3 [35]. Statistics Descriptions of the patient and lesion population are expressed in terms of median values and the interquartile range (IQR)., Relative volume change was assessed as a continuous variable and converted into a binary response category by imposing the response threshold T r, frequency and percentage are used to describe the response category distribution., Performance of the predictive models are expressed in terms of their mean with associated 95% confidence interval (CI), significance was evaluated by permutation tests (1000 data permutations) [36]., The False Discovery Rate (FDR) approach was used for multiple testing corrections [37]. Results Data Collection and Generation A total of 80 patients were found to have at least one lesion that met the inclusion criteria for our study., Of these patients 33 received Doxorubicin Monotherapy (DM) and 47 received Doxorubicin plus Evofosfamide (DE)., The number of contoured lesions per patient ranged from 1-11 with 54/80 or 67.5% of patients with two or more lesions, a total of 202 contoured lesions were included in the analysis, of which 90 received DM and 112 received DE., Median volume of delineated lesions at baseline was 4.17 cc (IQR 2.26 to 9.68). Median time between baseline and follow-up CT was 1.67 months (IQR 1.47 to 1.87). Radiomic features were extracted from original images as well as from different image transformations including five Laplacian of Gaussian filters (  = 1.0, 2.0,  3.0,  4.0,  5.0 mm),  eight wavelets decompositions,  and four non-linearities (exponential, square,  square root and logarithm)., This generated a set of 6592 features (1, 648 features per sub-volume of interest X 4 sub-volumes of interest)., After evaluating robustness to segmentation 1, 452 features (363 features per sub-volume of interest X 4 sub-volumes of interest) were removed., Unsupervised feature selection using clustering identified 75 features representative of highly correlated sets of radiomics features., After removing radiomic features at a volume-correlation coefficient threshold of 0.20 32 features remained., Data Analysis Using a response threshold (T r) of 50% the fraction of progressive lesions was 15.6% and 24.1% for the DM and DE regimes, respectively ( Figure 2 )., Of the patients with 2 or more lesions, 18.5% exhibited differences in individual lesion response. Significant differences in baseline volume were observed between lesion response categories (Figure 3 )., .

Annotation for FDR: {**: 0.001 < p <= 0.01}. For response prediction 5 models were cross- validated for each treatment regimen (i.e., 1 model with baseline volume,  1 model with baseline volume and 1 radiomic feature,  and so on), this process was repeated for 2 additional subgroups based on lesion volume on bas eline., The subgroups were determined using the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) outlier detection method lesions that had an absolute modified Z- score less than 3 were considered as the first subgroup., Lesions that had an absolute modified Z-score greater than 3 (i.e. outliers in terms of baseline volume) were considered as the second subgroup., Given the distribution of lesion volume included in this study lesions were considered outliers if their volume at baseline was greater than 16.05 cc., For both t he DM and DE regimen the best performing model consisted of 5 radiomic features, fit using all lesions,  irrespective of baseline volume ( Table 1 )., While the model for the DM regimen reached significance (FDR = 0.01) the model for the DE regimen only tren ded towards significance (FDR = 0.07)., Notably the performance for the DE model was significantly different from the volume-only model (p = 1.4X10-7 for AUPRC)., Of the 5 features ultimately selected for each model 3 were the same for both models (lesion volume at baseline and 2 gray- level dependance matrix features)., Generally speaking, the AUROC was higher than the AUPRC, as expected, given the class imbalance. The AUPRC suggests an approximate 4.7 and 2.4- fold increase in predictive capacity compared to a no- skill classifier for the DM and DE models, respectively., The MCC for the DM model indicates a moderate positive relationship between the features and the classification target, whereas the MCC for the DE model indicates a negligible relationship., se ns ific 1 n); he on rst of on as s, M ds nt for el as ld ls, he le .

distribution, we attempted to fit a model with 3-fold cross-validation instead of 10-fold, such that each split would have at least one progressive lesion., The AUPRC for this result suggests a

Monitoring size changes in a cancerous lesion is an important aspect of cancer management, as it can provide valuable information about the tumor's response to treatment and its potential for progression., Through careful evaluation of these changes in volume over time healthcare professionals can make informed decisions about treatment strategies, including adjusting treatment doses or switching to alternative therapies [38]., Predicting these lesion-specific responses however, represents a paradigm shift and could present an opportunity to augment existing clinical decision making criteria [39]., In this work we investigated the utility of radiomic biomarkers for prediction of lesion-specific systemic treatment response in pulmonary metastases and achieved a strong predictive value for lesions receiving doxorubicin monotherapy., Most published radiomic studies extract radiomic features from only one lesion even in multi metastatic patients., While analyzing a single lesion may be less time-consuming and involve simpler mathematical models it may also lead to misevaluation of the cancer inter-lesion heterogeneity [7],  [17],  [40], [41]., This is especially consequential in the context of predicting patient-specific outcomes such as overall treatment response or patient survival, hence,  we sought only to predict tumor response at a lesion level., Trebeschi et al developed a radiomics signature to do exactly this using a cohort of 203 patients receiving immunotherapy (123 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 80 melanoma patients) [18]., In their study although the radiomic biomarker on 303 lesions from the 70 patients of the test reached significant performance (AUROC = 0.66 , p < 0.01), only a trend towards significance was obtained from the nodal metastases in melanoma patients (AUROC = ., CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder who has granted medRxiv a license to display the

medRxiv preprint 0.64, p = 0.05) and application of the signature was not significant for pulmonary and hepatic melanoma lesions (AUROC = 0.55)., However in their NSCLC cohort,  significant performance was observed in pulmonary (AUROC = 0.83, p < 0.001) and nodal metastases (AUROC = 0.78,  p < 0.001)., Sun et al confirmed the association of their previously-validated radiomic score (CD8-Rscore) with response to immunotherapy at lesion level and patient level in 136 patients with advanced melanoma [17]., Notably predictivity of lesion response using their CD8-Rscore was dependent on the tumor location, with moderate predictive value for subcutaneous lesions (AUROC = 0.65,  p = 0.007), and large hepatic (AUROC = 0.70,  p = 0.002) and nodal metastases (AUROC = 0.62,  p = 0.03), but no significant association was found for pulmonary lesions., In terms of model performance our predictive value (AUROC) values align quite closely with these studies., It is important to note however,  that due to the class imbalance in our dataset, AUROC is not the most appropriate measure of model performance., We were most interested in predicting progressive lesions and the fraction of these were less than 0.5 (i.e.,  the classes were not balanced)., For this the AUPRC is more informative, as this measure concerns itself with finding all the progressive lesions (recall) without accidentally marking any non-progressive as progressive (precision)., The baseline for this metric is equal to the fraction of progressive lesions. For example the set of lesions receiving DM consists of 16.9% progressive examples and 83.1% non-progressive examples, which sets the baseline AUPRC at 0.169., Obtaining an AUPRC of 0.79 represents a 4.7-fold increase from baseline or a no-skill classifier. This is further reflected in the MCC measure which takes into account true and false positives and negatives and is generally regarded as a balanced measure., The stark difference observed between the metrics presented here underscore the need for thoughtful choice when it comes to assessing model performance [34]., The aforementioned studies that perform lesion level response prediction align with existing response criteria in that a relative change in diameter was evaluated between baseline and follow-up [38]., In our study we evaluated a relative change in volume to define lesion level response where, to our knowledge,  no such response criteria currently exist., Results from the literature agree that volume measurement is a method with superior performance in lung tumor sizing, as well as in assessing tumor growth [42],  [43]., However measuring tumor volume is not always straightforward, as tumors can have irregular shapes and may be difficult to accurately measure using imaging techniques [44]., Reported volume measurement errors in lung lesions vary between 20% and 25% therefore, any relative change in volume beyond this could be considered to define a significant growth [45][47]., In our study, we implemented a conservative response threshold of 50%. Using this threshold we observed that in patients with 2+ lung metastases, 18.5% of patients had a mixed response (at least 1 progressive lesion and 1 non-progressive lesion)., This is consistent with the study from Trebeschi et al which also found that combined predictions made on individual lesions was associated with OS with a significant survival difference at 1 year of 25% (77% vs 52%, log rank p = 0.02)., Mixed response has been linked with poorer outcomes in several advanced cancer types [18] [48][51], as such,  it would not be unexpected to observe ., CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity., (which was not certified by peer review)The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted October 13, 2023. ,  https, //doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.22.23294942doi, medRxiv preprint the same in our dataset., Curiously the model for lesions receiving DM was able to achieve significant performance, especially compared to the model for lesions receiving DE., It is possible that there is an underlying biological effect which could explain lesion response to DE that imaging is simply not as sensitive to., The differential performance observed between the models for the DM and DE regimens is again consistent with Trebeschi et al , predictive performance for lesion level response prediction was evaluated and variation in AUROC was observed between intervention types (immunotherapy versus chemotherapy)[18]., Baseline lesion volume was significantly different between response categories irrespective of treatment., Specifically we observed that progressive lesions were smaller in size compared to non-progressive lesions., Evofosfamide becomes activated in hypoxic low pH environments which have been shown to be present in sarcoma but is usually associated with larger sarcomas or sarcomas with more tumor heterogeneity related to differences in blood perfusion and/or tumor necrosis[24]., It is possible that smaller and/or more homogeneously enhancing lesions would not contain the type of environment leading to activation of evofosfamide, which may explain our observation in the DE regimen., Mathematical models for tumor growth kinetics have been widely used in precision oncology. One of the main findings from early studies is that tumor growth is not entirely exponential over time,  left unperturbed,  the specific growth rate of a tumor can slow down[52]., The lesion growth in our study was perturbed in the sense that an intervention was given hence it is unclear if our observation can be fully explained theoretically., Given the difference in baseline volume between response categories we removed volume- correlated radiomic features from our analysis., Previous work has shown that removal of these volume-dependent features can negatively affect model performance in the setting of patient- level risk stratification., Although removing these features may have ultimately affected our model performance we believe that machine learning methods should have a good trade-off between transparency, performance and quality of fit., Both models included a feature calculated from a derived sub-volume of interest (the lesion core and interior rim)., To this end our results align with Sun et al, as 3 features in their validated signature are sourced from a peripheral ring [53]., While we would not expect the features to be the same as the task is different (predicting immunotherapy versus chemotherapy response), the inclusion of peritumoral features is nonetheless interesting and likely worth further exploration in future radiomics studies., Our study has potential limitations. While our model achieved strong performance to predict lesion-specific systemic treatment response in pulmonary metastases, relying solely on volume changes at one site may not provide a comprehensive picture of the tumor's behavior., Cancer is a complex disease that can spread to other areas of the body and metastatic lesions may behave differently with respect to one another and the primary tumor., We chose to focus on the lung as it was the most common metastatic site in our patient population and therefore represented the most populous lesion population which was therefore less prone to produce statistical issues related to overfitting and multiple testing., The lung is also a common metastatic site in many other cancers including but not limited to colorectal,  head and neck,  breast and urologic cancers [54]., Conducting prospective validation studies in LMS and other sarcomas will provide important evidence regarding the clinical utility and generalizability of your signature ., CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity., (which was not certified by peer review)The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted October 13, 2023. ,  https, //doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.22.23294942doi, medRxiv preprint across different tumor types., It will help assess the performance of the model in real-world settings and validate its ability to predict lesion-level response accurately., Furthermore monitoring multiple sites within a patient's tumor can provide valuable insights into the heterogeneity of treatment response., Tumors can exhibit spatial variation in their response to therapy with some sites showing a positive response while others may not., By monitoring multiple sites it is possible to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the tumor's overall response to treatment., We leave prospective validation extension to other sarcomas, and monitoring of multiple sites for future work., Conclusion In this work we present a radiomic-based model to predict lesion-level response to standard systemic treatments for metastatic LMS patients., This novel approach has the potential to contribute to personalized treatment approaches and facilitate more effective decision-making in the management of metastatic patients towards improved patient outcomes and optimized treatment strategies., Continued research and validation efforts can further strengthen the evidence base and potentially translate our findings into clinical practice for the benefit of patients., Informed Consent and Patient Details This study was performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations., Given the retrospective and non-interventional nature of the study a waiver of informed consent was granted., The study protocol was approved by the University Health Network (UHN) Research Ethics Board (REB) IRB no., 2020-57.

      "question": "What is the main objective of the research in this paper?",
      "answer": "The main objective of the research in this paper is to investigate the utility of radiomic biomarkers for predicting lesion-specific treatment responses in patients with metastatic leiomyosarcoma. The study aims to develop a radiomic model that can accurately predict the progression of individual lung metastases based on image-derived features from pre-treatment computed tomography (CT) scans. This approach acknowledges the biological diversity within metastatic subclones and seeks to enhance treatment management strategies by identifying resistant clones in the context of systemic therapy."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you summarize the abstract of the paper?",
      "answer": "The abstract of the paper discusses the variability in treatment responses among individual tumors in patients with metastatic leiomyosarcoma, despite similar histological classifications. The study explores the use of radiomic biomarkers to predict lesion-specific treatment resistance. Utilizing a dataset of 202 lung metastases from 80 patients, the researchers developed a radiomic model based on 1648 pre-treatment CT features to forecast lesion progression. The model demonstrated a significant predictive capacity, achieving an area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.79, indicating a 5-fold increase in predictive ability compared to a no-skill classifier. The study highlights the importance of assessing treatment response at the lesion level to account for biological diversity among metastatic subclones, which could enhance management strategies, including targeted ablation of resistant clones during systemic therapy."

      "question": "Describe the methodology used in the paper.",
      "answer": "The methodology used in the paper \"Radiomic-Based Prediction of Lesion-Specific Systemic Treatment Response in Metastatic Disease\" involves several key steps aimed at predicting treatment responses in metastatic leiomyosarcoma patients based on radiomic features extracted from CT scans. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the methodology:\n\n1. **Data Collection**:\n   - The study utilized a dataset from a randomized Phase III trial comparing Doxorubicin Monotherapy (DM) versus Doxorubicin plus Evofosfamide (DE) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma. A total of 640 patients were enrolled, and the imaging data from 180 leiomyosarcoma patients were analyzed.\n\n2. **Image Segmentation**:\n   - Contrast-enhanced CT images were obtained at two time points: baseline (prior to treatment) and after two cycles of systemic therapy. The images were processed using the open-source software 3D Slicer to segment all identifiable lung lesions, which were defined as measurable according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.\n\n3. **Morphological Image Processing**:\n   - The segmented lesions were resampled to a common voxel size. Morphological operations were applied to define sub-volumes of interest within the lesions, specifically the lesion core and internal/external rims.\n\n4. **Radiomic Feature Extraction**:\n   - Radiomic features were extracted according to the Imaging Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI) using the PyRadiomics software. A total of 1648 features were calculated for each lesion and its sub-volumes, including first-order statistical measures, shape descriptors, and texture features derived from various matrices.\n\n5. **Data Analysis**:\n   - A lesion-wise evaluation of volume change between baseline and follow-up was performed. The percent change in volume was used as a metric for treatment response, with a defined threshold to categorize lesions as progressive or non-progressive.\n\n6. **Response Prediction**:\n   - Features that were not robust to segmentation were removed. A correlation analysis was performed, and features were hierarchically clustered to select representative features. Up to four features were selected for model inclusion using the SelectKBest method. Logistic modeling was employed for classification tasks, with five models tested for each treatment arm.\n\n7. **Cross-Validation**:\n   - A stratified 10-fold cross-validation approach was used to account for class imbalance between response categories. The process was repeated multiple times to improve the performance estimate of the machine learning model.\n\n8. **Model Performance Evaluation**:\n   - Model performance was quantified using metrics such as Area Under the Curve for the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC), Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), and Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Statistical significance was assessed using permutation tests and the False Discovery Rate (FDR) approach for multiple testing corrections.\n\n9. **Sensitivity Analysis**:\n   - The response prediction task was repeated for two additional subgroups based on lesion volume, using a median absolute deviation (MAD) outlier detection method to identify population-specific outliers.\n\nOverall, the methodology emphasizes a comprehensive approach to extracting and analyzing radiomic features to predict lesion-specific treatment responses, highlighting the importance of inter-lesion heterogeneity in metastatic disease management."

      "question": "How was the data analyzed in the study?",
      "answer": "In the study, the data analysis involved several key steps:\n\n1. **Response Categorization**: The researchers performed a lesion-wise evaluation of the relative change in volume between baseline and follow-up CT scans using the PyRadiomics software. They defined the lesion volume at baseline and after two cycles of systemic therapy using the shape descriptive radiomic feature VoxelVolume. A response threshold (Tr) was established, where lesions with a positive volume change greater than Tr were labeled as progressive, while all other lesions were labeled as non-progressive.\n\n2. **Feature Selection and Robustness**: Features that were not robust concerning the segmentation process were removed. Each lesion segmentation was eroded and dilated isotropically, and radiomic features that exhibited a concordance correlation coefficient below 0.8 between the original and derived segmentations were excluded. Following this, a correlation analysis was conducted, and radiomic features were hierarchically clustered using the agglomerative unweighted pair group method. Features with a volume-correlation coefficient greater than 0.20 were also removed to eliminate potential confounding effects.\n\n3. **Model Development**: Up to four radiomic features were selected for model inclusion using the SelectKBest method from the sklearn module, which calculates ANOVA F-values between the target and each feature. Logistic modeling was employed for classification tasks, testing five models for each treatment arm, including models with baseline volume only and models with additional selected radiomic features.\n\n4. **Cross-Validation**: To account for class imbalance between response categories, a stratified 10-fold cross-validation was used to fit the data for each modeling strategy. This method preserved the same class distribution in each subset as in the original dataset. The cross-validation procedure was repeated multiple times to improve the estimated performance of the machine learning model.\n\n5. **Performance Metrics**: Model performance was quantified using Area Under the Curve for the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) and Precision-Recall (AUPRC) curves, along with the evaluation of Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC). A paired Wilcox test was used to assess differences in performance distribution between models.\n\n6. **Sensitivity Analysis**: The response prediction task was repeated for two additional subgroups identified through a median absolute deviation outlier detection method, allowing for a more nuanced analysis of the data.\n\nOverall, the analysis combined statistical methods, machine learning techniques, and rigorous validation processes to assess the predictive capacity of radiomic features for treatment response in metastatic lesions."

      "question": "How does the paper address potential biases in the research?",
      "answer": "The paper addresses potential biases in the research through several methodological approaches:\n\n1. **Outlier Detection and Removal**: The authors employed a median absolute deviation (MAD) outlier detection method to identify and remove population-specific outliers based on lesion volume at baseline. This step helps to mitigate the influence of extreme values that could skew the results and lead to biased interpretations.\n\n2. **Feature Robustness Assessment**: The study ensured that only robust radiomic features were included in the analysis. Features that exhibited low concordance correlation coefficients (below 0.8) between original and derived segmentations were dropped. This process helps to ensure that the features used in the predictive models are reliable and not artifacts of the segmentation process.\n\n3. **Volume-Correlation Control**: To eliminate potential confounding effects related to lesion volume, the authors removed radiomic features that had a high correlation with lesion volume (greater than 0.20). This step is crucial as it helps to isolate the predictive power of the radiomic features from the inherent variability introduced by lesion size.\n\n4. **Stratified Cross-Validation**: The authors used a stratified 10-fold cross-validation approach to fit the data for each modeling strategy. This method preserves the same class distribution in each fold as in the original dataset, which helps to reduce bias that could arise from imbalanced classes.\n\n5. **Sensitivity Analysis**: The response prediction task was repeated for different subgroups, including those identified as outliers. This analysis allows for the examination of how the model performs across different patient populations and helps to identify any biases that may arise from specific subgroups.\n\n6. **Multiple Testing Corrections**: The authors applied the False Discovery Rate (FDR) approach for multiple testing corrections, which helps to control for type I errors that can occur when multiple hypotheses are tested simultaneously.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, the authors aimed to minimize biases and enhance the validity of their findings regarding the prediction of lesion-specific treatment responses in metastatic disease."

      "question": "What validation methods were used to ensure the reliability of the results?",
      "answer": "The validation methods used in the study to ensure the reliability of the results included:\n\n1. **Stratified 10-Fold Cross-Validation**: This method was employed to fit the data for each modeling strategy. It preserves the same class distribution in each subset as in the original dataset, which is crucial for maintaining the balance between progressive and non-progressive lesions.\n\n2. **Repeated Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation**: To improve the estimated performance of the machine learning model, the cross-validation procedure was repeated multiple times (set to 5 for this study). This approach helps mitigate the variability that can arise from different splits of the data.\n\n3. **Concordance Correlation Coefficient**: Radiomic features that were not robust with respect to the segmentation process were removed based on their concordance correlation coefficient, ensuring that only reliable features were included in the model.\n\n4. **Hierarchical Clustering**: A correlation analysis was performed, and radiomic features were hierarchically clustered to identify representative features, which helps in reducing redundancy among features.\n\n5. **Outlier Detection**: A median absolute deviation (MAD) outlier detection method was applied to identify and manage population-specific outliers based on lesion volume, ensuring that the model's performance was not skewed by extreme values.\n\n6. **Performance Metrics**: Model performance was quantified using Area Under the Curve for the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC), Precision-Recall (AUPRC) curves, and Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC). These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's predictive capabilities.\n\n7. **Statistical Testing**: A paired Wilcox test was used to test for differences in performance distribution between the model with volume alone and the best performing model, adding another layer of validation to the results.\n\nThese methods collectively contribute to the robustness and reliability of the predictive model developed in the study."

      "question": "Are there any contradictions between this paper's findings and previous research?",
      "answer": "The findings of the paper \"Radiomic-Based Prediction of Lesion-Specific Systemic Treatment Response in Metastatic Disease\" present several points of alignment and potential contradiction with previous research.\n\n1. **Alignment with Previous Research**: \n   - The paper emphasizes the heterogeneity of tumors and the varying responses of metastatic lesions to treatment, which is consistent with existing literature that highlights cancer heterogeneity as a significant factor influencing treatment outcomes (references [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]).\n   - The study's focus on lesion-specific responses aligns with recent trends in radiomics, where researchers are increasingly recognizing the importance of assessing multiple lesions rather than relying on single-lesion evaluations (references [17], [18], [40], [41]).\n\n2. **Contradictions with Previous Research**:\n   - The paper claims a novel approach in predicting lesion-specific responses using radiomic features, suggesting that no successful predictive model has been implemented for individual lesions in metastatic patients prior to this study. This contrasts with studies like those by Trebeschi et al. and Sun et al., which have reported on the predictive capabilities of radiomic features at the lesion level (references [17], [18]). While the authors acknowledge these studies, they argue that their approach is distinct in its methodology and focus on systemic treatments rather than immunotherapy.\n   - The study found significant differences in predictive performance between the two treatment regimens (Doxorubicin Monotherapy vs. Doxorubicin plus Evofosfamide), with the model for the DE regimen trending towards significance but not achieving it. This contrasts with the expectation that combination therapies would generally yield better predictive outcomes, as seen in other studies (reference [18]).\n\n3. **Methodological Differences**:\n   - The authors argue for the superiority of volume measurements over diameter measurements in assessing tumor response, which is a point of contention in the literature. Some studies have shown that diameter measurements can be sufficient, while others support the use of volume measurements for a more accurate assessment (references [42], [43], [44], [45]).\n\nIn summary, while the paper builds on established concepts of tumor heterogeneity and the need for lesion-specific assessments, it presents findings that may contradict or challenge previous studies regarding the effectiveness of radiomic models in predicting treatment responses, particularly in the context of different therapeutic approaches."
