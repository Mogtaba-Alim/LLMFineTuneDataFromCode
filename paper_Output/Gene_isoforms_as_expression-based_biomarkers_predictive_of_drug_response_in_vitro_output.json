Given the high frequency of mRNA splicing in cancers linking this feature to drugresponse will open new avenues of research in biomarker discovery., To identify robusttranscriptomic biomarkers for drug response across studies we develop a meta-analyticalframework combining the pharmacological data from two large-scale drug screening data-sets., We use an independent pan-cancer pharmacogenomic dataset to test the robustness ofour candidate biomarkers across multiple cancer types., We further analyze two independentbreast cancer datasets and find that speci fic isoforms of IGF2BP2, NECTIN4,  ITGB6,  and KLHDC9 are signi ficantly associated with AZD6244,  lapatinib,  erlotinib, and paclitaxel,  respectively., Our results support isoform expressions as a rich resource for biomarkerspredictive of drug response.DOI, 10.1038/s41467-017-01153-8 OPEN 1Princess Margaret Cancer Centre,  University Health Network, 101 College Street,  Toronto,  ON,  Canada M5G1L7.2Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto,  101 College Street,  Toronto,  ON, Canada M5G1L7.3Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montreal,  110 Pine Avenue West,  Montreal,  QC, Canada H2W 1R7.4Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research,  620 University Avenue, Toronto,  ON,  Canada M5G2C1.5Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology,  Department of Medicine, University of Toronto,  27 King s College Circle,  Toronto,  ON, Canada M5S 1A1.6Department of Computer Science,  University of Toronto,  10 King s College Road, Toronto,  ON,  Canada M5S 3G4.7Ontario Institute of Cancer Research,  661 University Avenue, Suite 510,  Toronto,  ON,  Canada M5G 0A3., Correspondence and requests for materials should be addressed to B.H-K.

As the detection of tran- scripts and genes using RNA-seq is based on high-resolution short-reads sequencing instead of probe design, they have the potential to overcome these limitations17., Recent initiatives have pro filed hundreds of cancer cell lines using Illumina RNA-seq technology3 2022., As part of CCLE the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT released RNAseq pro files of 935 cancer cell lines through the Cancer Genomics Hub (CGHub23, now moved to the NCI Genomic Data COmmon24), whereas Genentech deposited RNA-seq data for 675 cell lines on the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) as part of their Genentech Cell Line Screening Initiative (gCSI)20, 22., Two other initiatives used RNA-seq to pro file panels of 70 (GRAY3) and 84 (UHN21) breast cancer cell lines., The availability of these valuable datasets offers unprecedented opportunities to further explore the transcriptomic features of cancer cells and study their association with drug response., In this study we explore the genome-wide transcriptomic landscape of large panels of cancer cell lines to identify isoform- level expression features predictive of drug response in vitro., On the basis of our new metaanalytical framework combining the GDSC and CCLE pharmacogenomic data for biomarker Drug dose- response curvesDrug dose- response curvesRNA-seq profilesGDSC CCLE Fit linear regression per gene Select best isoformBreast cancer biomarkers Drug dose- response curvesGRAY Drug dose- response curvesRNA-seq profilesUHNFinal validation new datasetBreast pre-validation published dataset Pre-validated biomarkersValidated biomarkers Drug dose- response curvesRNA-seq profilesRNA-seq profiles gCSI Pan-cancer validation published datasetValidated biomarkersSignificant biomarkers (gene + isoforms) Fig., 1 Analysis design of the study.

We developed a meta- analysis pipeline enabling identi fication of molecular features predictive of sensitivity to 15 drugs (Fig., 1; Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Fig. 1) across two large pharmacoge- nomics studies, namely CCLE and GDSC (Fig. 1). CCLE used the CellTiter-Glo (Promega) pharmacological assay whereas GDSC used Syto60 (Invitrogen)25, providing us with the opportunity to discover biomarkers generalizable to multiple measures of drug sensitivities., We identi fied a wide range of statistically signi ficant biomarkers for each drug (10 to 1984 biomarkers with FDR <1% and concordance index >0.55, Fig., 2a Supplementary Data 1), with a signi ficantly larger proportion of isoform-based bio- markers are predictive of drug response (Wilcoxon-signed rank testp-value <103, Fig., 2a). For the majority of genes identi fied asbiomarkers the highest ranking isoform, but not the overall gene expression,  is signi ficantly predictive of drug response (Fig., 2b). We investigated the discriminatory features between the gene- specificisoform-speci fic, and common biomarkers by first assessing the number of alternatively spliced isoforms for each selected gene (Supplementary Fig., 2). As expected the largest proportion of isoform-speci fic biomarkers originate from genes with multiple transcripts., We also categorized the predictive features by their biological types protein coding,  antisense, pro- cessed transcript,  linc RNA,  and pseudogenes (SupplementaryFig.3)., Although the largest proportion of protein-coding bio- markers are isoformic (isoform-speci fic and common), the pro- cessed transcript biomarkers is dominated by isoform-speci fic ones., The pseudogene type contains the lowest ratio of isoform- specific biomarkers. We further tested whether the number of associations with drug sensitivity was signi ficantly larger for isoforms than gene, copy number alterations,  or mutations., Concurring with the Drug Sensitivity Prediction DREAM challenge6 we found that expression-based features were more signi ficantly associated with sensitivity for most of the drugs (Fig., 3a). Overall there were significantly more isoform-based biomarkers than gene expres- sion and copy number alterations (one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum testp-value <0.001, Fig., 3a) and their concordance index was superior (one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test p-value <0.001 Fig.3b)., However even though there were more isoform-basedCommonIsoform-specific Gene-specific110100100010, 000Isoforms GenesNumber of associated genes Percentage100 80 60 4020 0Paclitaxel17-AAG PD-0325901AZD6244TAE684AZD0530 PD-0332991LapatinibErlotinibCrizotinibNilotinibPLX4720Nutlin-3 PHA-665752Sorafenib Paclitaxel17-AAG PD-0325901AZD6244TAE684AZD0530 PD-0332991LapatinibErlotinibCrizotinibNilotinibPLX4720Nutlin-3 PHA-665752Sorafeniba b Fig., 2 Comparison of number of statistically signi ficant (FDR <1%) predictive biomarkers for each of the 15 drugs in common between CCLE and GDSC., aNumber of signi ficant associations for gene and isoform models.

Although these results are limited to a set of 1600 genes for which all data types were available they support isoform expression as a promising new class of biomarkers for the majority of the drugs in our training set., Pan-cancer validation of isoform-based biomarkers .W e first validated our candidate biomarkers identi fied in our training set using gCSI, a large pharmacogenomic dataset recently released by Genentech20, 22., This dataset contains 16 drugs, of which 5 are overlapping with our training set (Supplementary Fig. 4). Thanks to the large sample size of gCSI we observed high validation rate for multiple drugs (61 and 54% for erlotinib and lapatinib, respectively,  Fig., 4; Supplementary Data 2). Predicted and actual AAC values for the top biomarkers were reported for each tissue type in Supplementary Figs., 5,6and16. These new results clearly indicate that reasonable validation rate can be achieved when a large validation set is available., We further investigated the cases of paclitaxel and the MEK inhibitor PD-0325901. Both drugs have broad growth inhibitory effects as indicated by the large variance of drug sensitivity values (Fig., 4a, b). Concurring with our previous results26 we observed that AAC values were inconsistent between the training sets (GDSC and CCLE, Sup- plementary Fig., 7),finding that extends to the comparison of GDSC and gCSI dataset ( =0.36; Fig. 4a). On the contrary PD- 0325901 yielded moderate to high consistency in drug sensitivity data between the training sets ( =0.56, Supplementary Fig., 7) and with validation set ( =0.64 and 0.79 for GDSC vs. gCSI and CCLE vs. gCSI, respectively; Fig. 4a). In addition the selected biomarkers tended to yield higher correlation between thetraining and the test set for PD-0325901., These observations explains in part why the validation rate was low for paclitaxel whereas the number of biomarkers was high for PD-0325901 (Supplementary Table 2)., Pre-validation in an independent breast cancer dataset . In vitro validation of drug response biomarkers in fully independent datasets has been shown to be challenging2730., We therefore sought to assess the predictive value of our most promising iso- form biomarkers for eight drugs screened both in our training sets and in the independent breast cancer dataset published by Daemen et al.3(referred to as GRAY), which used the same pharmacological assay as CCLE., We first selected the signi ficant isoform-based biomarkers in our training set that were predictive in breast cancer cell lines (see Methods )., We assessed the predictive value of these biomarker candidates in GRAY and tested whether these isoform biomarkers were signi ficantly more predictive than their corresponding gene expression (Fig., 5; Supplementary Fig. 8; Supplementary Data 3). The validation success rate for isoformic biomarkers ranged from 0% (no vali- dated biomarkers for crizotinib) to 25% validated biomarkers for paclitaxel (Supplementary Table 2)., We found that the poor validation rate for crizotinib and sorafenib stems from incon- sistency in their pharmacological pro files (Supplementary Fig., 9). On the basis of the number and effect size of biomarker candi- dates that were signi ficant in GRAY we selected AZD6244,  lapatinib,  erlotinib,  and paclitaxel for further validation., Validation using a different pharmacological assay .

Similar to the pre-validation performed in GRAY we considered an isoformic biomarker to be validated if the linear association between its expression and drug sensitivity is both significant and in the same direction (same coef ficient sign in the regression model)., This resulted in validation of 2 out of 12 2 out of 5,  6 out of 11, and 11 out of 35 biomarkers for AZD6244,  lapatinib,  erlotinib,  and paclitaxel, respectively (Supplementary Table 2,  Supplementary Data 4., We selected the isoform with the largest effect size for each drug (Supplementary Table 4 known biomarkers are provided as reference in Supplementary Table 5)) and investigated its exon occupancy and correlation comparedwith the other isoforms of the same gene (Fig., 6; Supplementary Fig.10). The selected IGF2BP2-002 (ENST00000346192) NEC- TIN4 (ENST00000368012), and ITGB6-001 (ENST00000283249) isoforms were associated with sensitivity to AZD6244,  lapatinib, and erlotinib,  respectively (Fig., 6ac; Supplementary Fig. 10) whereas the KLHDC9-207 (ENST00000490724) isoform is associated with lack of sensitivity to paclitaxel (Fig., 6d; Supplementary Fig. 10). For KLHDC9-207  the predictive isoform was highly correlated with other isoforms of the same gene, sharing similar exon occupancy (Fig., 6h) whereas predictive isoform for IGF2BP2-002 , NECTIN-2014 , and ITGB6-001 present a more speci fic expression pattern (Fig., 6eg).

Controlling for the large number of isoforms we found that signi ficantly more genes had one of their isoforms predictive of response compared with overall gene expression for the vast majority of the drugs (Fig., 2a). Importantly only a minority of biomarkers were solely predictive based on their overall gene expression and would have been missed by focusing on isoform expressions (Fig., 2b), supporting isoforms as a promising, untapped resource for drug response biomarkers. Recognizing the challenges involved in biomarker discovery and validation from in vitro drug screening data22, 25, 27, 28, 3034, we further assessed the predictive value of our newly discovered isoform-based biomarkers for five drugs in the pan-cancer gCSI dataset, as well as four drugs (AZD6244,  lapatinib,  erlotinib,  andpaclitaxel) in GRAY and UHN, two independent breast cancer pharmacogenomic datasets (Fig., 1; Supplementary Table 1). Thanks to the large sample size of gCSI we obtained validation rates of over 50% for some targeted therapies (Supplementary Table 2)., As expected we found that consistency of pharmaco- logical pro files between training set as well as the validation set was determinant to ensure reasonable validation rate., When testing the robustness of our biomarker candidate in breast cancer we obtained low validation rates for eight drugs (33 51%, Supplementary Table 2) in our pre-validation phase, despite the fact that this study used the same pharmacological assay as CCLE to generate their drug sensitivity data (CellTiter-Glo, Supple- mentary Table 1)., We found that many of the strongest 0.10.20.3a ENST00000283249NECTIN4 isoformsIGF2BP2 isoforms ENST00000490724ENST00000346192 0.30.40.5 0.10.30.5ENST00000368012b ITGB6 isoforms c d KLHDC9 isoforms ENST00000490724 ENST00000392191ENST00000469647 ENST00000368011 ENST00000392192 ENST00000494418ENST00000471613 ENST00000475934 0.0 0.60.0 0.4 Correlation with the best isoform e f g hENST00000382199 ENST00000346192 ENST00000457616 ENST00000421047 ENST00000461957 ENST00000493302 ENST00000466476 ENST00000494906 ENST00000496495 ENST00000464166 0.00.6 0.00 0.20 Relative expressionCorrelation with the best isoform ENST00000409872ENST00000620391 ENST00000409583ENST00000283249 ENST00000409967ENST00000475438 ENST00000477514ENST00000498478 ENST00000459712ENST00000428609 0.0 0.60.00.4Correlation with the best isoformENST00000368012 ENST00000486694 0.00.6 0.00.6 Correlation with the best isoformAAC AAC AAC MDAMB134VIMFM223 MDAMB157ZR751HCC1937HCC1187AU655 HCC1143 MDAMB231BT549SW 527HCC1806MDAMB157ZR751 MDAMB134VIHCC1143 MDAMB231HCC1419MFM223BT549AU655 HCC1806SW 527HCC202HDQP1HCC1937MDAMB157 MDAMB134VIZR751BT549SW 527HCC1937HCC1143HCC1806MFM223HCC1187HCC202HCC1419AU655MDAMB157ZR751AU655 HCC1419MFM223HCC202SW 527 MDAMB134VIBT549HCC1937HCC1187HCC1806HCC1143AAC 0.5Relative expression Relative expression Relative expression Fig., 6 Validation of the candidate isoforms predictive of response to aeAZD6244,  b, flapatinib,  c, gerlotinib,  and d, hpaclitaxel in the independent UHN dataset generated where a different pharmacological assay (sulforhodamine B assay) was used to measure drug sensitivity., adCell lines are ordered by their sensitivity to the drug of interest and their isoform expression is shown in the heatmap, with the drug sensitivity (AAC) plotted below., ehExon occupancy of each candidate isoform (*) is visualized using the Integrative Genomic Viewer with a barplot on the right side representing the correla tion () of expression between each isoform and the candidate isoform (red bar)., A vertical dashed line represents =0.8 to identify highly correlated isoforms of the same geneNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI, 10.1038/s41467-017-01153-8 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS |8,  1126 |DOI, 10.1038/s41467-017-01153-8 |www.nature.com/naturecommunications 7 biomarkers were signi ficantly more predictive of drug sensitivity at the isoform level compared to the overall gene expression level (Wilcoxon-signed rank test p<0.05, Fig., 3). Given that we and others have shown that the choice of pharmacological assay may in fluence drug sensitivity measurements22, 25, 31, we sought to validate our candidate iso- form biomarkers using the sulforhodamine B assay (SRB), which differs from the assays used in the training and pre-validation datasets (Fig., 1). We selected 14 breast cancer cell lines and screened them with the set of four drugs. Despite the small sample size we found 21 isoform biomarkers whose association is close to signi ficance ( p<0.1, Supplementary Table 2)., We selected the most predictive isoform for each drug to investigate its correlation with the other isoforms of the same gene (Fig., 6). AZD6244 is a highly selective MAPK-ERK kinase inhibitor. As a biomarker predictive of response to the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 in breast cancer we identi fied ENST00000346192, one of the longest isoforms of the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA- binding protein 2 ( IGF2BP2 ) (Fig., 6e), which codes a protein with 556 amino acids. It has been shown that IGF2BP2 stabilizes and regulates many oncogenic proteins such as NRAS MAPK1 , and RAF1 involved in the NRAS-MEK-ERK-MAPK signaling path- way, hyperactivated in many cancers35.A sIGF2BP2 lies upstream of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK )/extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK) pathway, this suggests that IGF2BP2 could be a putative biomarker of sensitivity for com- pounds acting upstream of the MAPK-ERK pathway and target- ingMEK1/2 such as AZD6244., We investigated the association between isoform expressions and sensitivity to lapatinib a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which interrupts the HER2/neu and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR ) pathways, and is a FDA-approved drug for breast cancer., In our study NECTIN4 isoform expression (ENSG00000143217) has been associated with sensitivity to lapatinib (Fig., 6b). It is the longest and the only protein-coding isoform of NECTIN4 (Fig. 6f). It has been reported that Nectin-4 is overexpressed in several human cancers including lung, and breast cancer36., Furthermore it has been shown that expression of Nectin-4 strongly correlates with the basal-like marker EGFR in breast cancer, thus proposed as a putative new histological and ser- ological tumor-associated biomarker37, 38., This strengthens our hypothesis that the expression of Nectin-4 isoform would sensi- tize a subset of breast cancer cells to lapatinib., Our results also indicate that sensitivity to the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib, can be predicted by the expression of the ENST00000283249 isoform of ITGB6 (Fig., 6c). Previous reports showed that the interaction between integrins and several receptor tyrosine kinases like HER2 andEGFR leads to a crosstalk between signaling events that have been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis39, 40., Desai et al.41recently identi fied a significant positive correlation between ITGB6 and EGFR pro- teins, suggesting that ITGB6 andEGFR are interacting, and that ITGB6 isoform expression sensitizes cells towards erlotinib,  an EGFR inhibitor., Lack of sensitivity or innate resistance to chemotherapies is a major issue in current breast cancer management42., We found that expression of the ENST00000490724 isoform of the kelch domain-containing 9 ( KLHDC9 ) gene is associated with lack of sensitivity to paclitaxel in breast cancer cell lines (Fig., 6d). Paclitaxel is a known microtubule stabilizer that inhibit cell division (mitosis) and is a broad chemotherapeutic agent., KLHDC9 has been characterized as an interaction partner of cyclin A1/CDK2 complex a key regulator of the mitotic cell cycle43., Furthermore KLHDC8B , another member of the Kelch domain-containing protein family has been implicated in mitotic regulation and chromosomal segregation in lymphoma44.W ehypothesize that a lower expression of KLHDC9 isoform will negatively affect mitotic integrity, potentiating the activity of paclitaxel on rapidly dividing cells., However additional char- acterization of the biology underlying the isoform speci ficity of this association are required to draw firm conclusion on the functional relation between KLDHC9 and pacliatxel resistance (Fig., 6h). This study has several potential limitations. First our bio- marker discovery pipeline is restricted to univariate linear asso- ciation between gene and isoform expression and drug sensitivity., These two restrictions have been imposed to mitigate the risk of overfitting as the development of multivariate, potentially non- linear predictors of in vitro drug sensitivity has been proven to be challenging27, 28., A larger compendium of pharmacogenomic datasets will be necessary to overcome this. A second limitation lies in the use of a single processing pipeline to quantify expression of each individual transcripts from Illumina RNA-seq data., We choose to use the HISAT2/StringTie pipeline for RNA- seq18because of its excellent performance in recent benchmarks45, 46., We recognize that many alternatives exist4749 but their comparison is out of the scope of the present study., Third we used a bootstrapping procedure, coupled with a Wilcoxon-signed rank test to statistically compare our candidate biomarkers to a model including tissue type as sole predictor., We recognize that the dependency across bootstraps may in flate the p-values. New statistical testing procedures are yet to be devel- oped to properly address this issue. Fourth the tissue-speci fic validation of our biomarkers is limited to breast cancer cell lines, the only tissue type for which we had multiple independent pharmacological and molecular datasets available., Lastly we are aware that clinical relevance of our candidate isoform biomarkers remains to be tested in vivo, using patient-derived xenografts and clinical samples in both retrospective and prospective studies., The release of RNA-seq and pharmacological pro files of such samples will allow to further challenge our findings in future studies., The advent of RNA-sequencing technology enables ef ficient quanti fication of alternatively spliced transcripts in cancer cells., Our genome-wide search for biomarkers demonstrates that gene isoforms constitute a rich resource of transcriptomic features associated with response to targeted and chemotherapies in vitro., We found that speci fic isoforms of IGF2BP2 NECTIN4,  ITGB6, and KLHDC9 were signi ficantly associated with AZD6244,  lapatinib,  erlotinib,  and paclitaxel, respectively,  in multiple screening using different pharmacological assays., Our results suggest that isoform-based biomarkers are more frequent and more signi ficantly associated with drug sensitivity than overall gene expression, opening new avenues for future biomarker dis- covery for in vitro and in vivo drug screening., Methods Published pharmacogenomics studies . We used our PharmacoGx platform50 to create curated annotated, and standardized pharmacogenomic datasets,  which comprises CCLE2,  gCSI22,  GDSC1, and GRAY3(Supplementary Table 1)., CCLE gCSI, and GRAY pharmacological data were generated using the CellTiter-Glo assay (which quantitates ATP, Promega),  whereas GDSC used the Syto60 assay (a nucleic acid stain,  Invitrogen)25., We updated CCLE gCSI, and GRAY PharmacoSets to include gene and isoform-level expression data processed from the raw RNA-seq pro files downloaded from CGHub23and NCBI GEO51, respectively., RNA-seq data processing . The RNA-seq reads were aligned to the Ensembl Genome Reference Consortium release GRCh3852using HISAT253and StringTie45, 46was used to annotate genes and isoforms,  and quantify their expression., Gencode version 2554was used as the transcript model reference for the alignment as well as for all gene and isoform quanti fications., Gencode annotated a total of 58037 genes,  which includes 19, 950 protein-coding genes,  15, 767 long noncoding RNA s (lncRNA s),  and 14, 650 pseudogenes., Expression values were computed as the log 2(FPKM+1)45 where FPKM represents the number ofARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI, 10.1038/s41467-017-01153-8 8 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS |8,  1126 |DOI, 10.1038/s41467-017-01153-8 |www.nature.com/naturecommunications fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads units that control sequence length and sequencing depth55., Pharmacological data processing . We developed a uni fied framework to process the raw pharmacological data of CCLE GDSC,  gCSI, and GRAY and to obtain the drug dose response curves using a standard curve fitting algorithm50(Supple- mentary Methods)., To summarize the drug dose response curves into a single- sensitivity measure we computed the area under the curve (AUC) metric, whichcombines both potency and ef ficacy of drug responses56(Supplementary Fig., 12; Supplementary Methods). Compared with IC 50and E maxmetrics which represent only one point on the drug dose response curve, AUC values are computed by integrating all data points., Consequently, AUC has been shown to be more reproducible across pharmacogenomic studies28,31. In this study, we used the area above the drug dose response curve (AAC =1AUC; Supplementary Fig. 12) so that higher AAC values represent higher drug sensitivity. Biomarker discovery . To identify gene and isoform expression robustly associated with drug sensitivity we developed a machine learning pipeline combining linear regression models with a bootstrapping procedure for stringent model selection.Our choice of model assumes a linear relationship between molecular features and drug responses., Although violation of this assumption may result in biased pre- dictions linear models are robust to variation or noise in the data, making themless prone to over fitting in a high-dimensional context such as pharmacogenomics., Therefore the association between each molecular feature and response to a given drug is assessed by fitting linear models using the gene or isoform expression across cell lines as predictor variables, adjusted for tissue of origin of cancer cell lines, and their sensitivity values to the given drug as dependent variables (Supplementary Fig.13)., To assess the association of each gene and its isoforms to a given drug three linear models were constructed for each dataset as following,  M 0, Y140TT,  1 M1, Y140TTGXG, 2 M2, Y140TTIIG8IG2GI,  3 where Trepresents the tissues of origin as a vector of size N1 , Nis the number of cell lines, Ydenotes the drug sensitivity vector of size N 1 containing the drug sensitivity values (AAC) of the cell lines treated by the drug of interest, XG represents a vector of size N 1 of log 2normalized FPKM values for the expression of gene G across all the cell lines, G Iis all the isoforms of gene G, I Gis a vector of sizeN 1 of log 2normalized FPKM values for each isoform of G across all the cell lines., The effect size of each association is quanti fied by GandI which indicate the strength of associations between drug response and the molecular feature ofinterest, adjusted for tissue type., To estimate standardized coef ficients from the linear model the variables YandX GandIGare scaled (standard deviation equals to one,  mean equals to zero)., The null model (Eq. ( 1)) estimates the association between drug response and tissue source as we previously showed that drug sensitivity in vitro is tissue speci fic57., The models in Eqs. ( 2) and ( 3) estimate the strength and signi ficance of the association between drug sensitivity and the gene level and its best isoform expressions, respectively., To address the lack of reproducibility of drug sensitivity measurements across studies2631, we developed a meta-analytical pipeline to combine the pharmacological data from CCLE and GDSC., The June 2014 release of CCLE consists of 11 670 experiments in which 24 drugs have been screened on 1053cancer cell lines from 24 tissue origins., GDSC release 5 comprises 79 903 experiments for 140 different drugs tested on a panel of up to 778 unique cell lines from 30 tissue types., The panel of drugs and cell lines screened in these two datasets overlapped for 15 compounds and 706 cell lines, respectively (Supplementary Data 5and6,  Supplementary Fig., 1). Univariate gene drug associations were computed using the linear models described in above-mentioned equations with CCLE RNA-seq data as predictors and CCLE and GDSC drug sensitivity data separately., We recognize that using CCLE RNA-seq data incombination with GDSC is suboptimal as gene expression of cell lines are subject to biological and technical variations 33., In the absence of RNA-seq data for GDSC we could only address the variations observed in the drug sensitivity measurements, which we demonstrated to be signi ficantly higher than variations in gene expression data26., To ensure that cell line identity was conserved across CCLE and GDSC we performed SNP fingerprinting (Supplementary Methods) and filtered out the cell lines identi fied as different across studies using a cutoff of 80% concordance26., In addition we compared the microarray expression pro files of cell lines between microarray and RNA-seq pro files, which resulted in good concordance (Supplementary Fig., 14) supporting that expression pro filing are consistent. To determine the most predictive isoform for each gene the predictive value (concordance index58) of all of its isoforms is estimated with Eq., ( 3) and the most significant isoform (the one with the smallest Bonferroni-corrected p-value) is selected for further analysis (Supplementary Fig., 13). Comparison of the predictive value of each model was performed using a bootstrapping procedure 100resampled datasets are generated, where the cell lines are obtained by sampling with replacements from all the cell lines with sensitivity and expression pro file available for a given drug., The linear regressions are solved for each bootstrap usingthe resampled set (~2/3) and unselected cell line set (~1/3) for training and testing, respectively., To evaluate the prediction performance of a gene or isoform model its vector of concordance index values is compared with a null model using a one- sided Wilcoxon-signed rank test., Bootstrapping procedure is applied on the gene and its most predictive isoform. We recognize that the dependence between thedifferent test sets may in flate the Wilcoxon s test p-values, however such bias would be present for both genes and isoforms,  resulting in a fair comparison., To combine thefitted models obtained from CCLE and GDSC their coef ficients and p-values were averaged and weighted by the number of cell lines in those datasets (Supplementary Fig., 13). To control for multiple testing we corrected the p-values obtained for all genes and isoforms, separately,  using the false discovery rate (FDR)method 59., Pan-cancer validation of isoform-based biomarkers . Beside CCLE the recent gCSI pharmacogenomic study20, 22is the only publicly available dataset including RNA-seq and pharmacogenomic pro files for a large panel of cell lines spanning across multiple cancer types (Supplementary Fig., 4). We therefore used gCSI to validate our candidate biomarkers in a pan-cancer setting. We computed the sig- nificance of the linear association between the biomarker expression and drug response controlled for tissue type (unadjusted p-value <0.05) with the same direction of association (sign of the coef ficient ) as the training sets., Similarly to the discovery phase we selected the validated biomarkers by statistically comparing the concordance index distribution of the isoform-based and gene-based models toconcordance indices of the null model (tissue type only) based on the bootstrap procedure using a one-sided Wilcoxon-signed rank test (Supplementary Fig., 13). Pre-validation of isoform-based biomarkers in breast cancer . We also validated the accuracy of our biomarkers using a previously-published independent dataset GRAY3, which includes RNA-seq of a panel of 70 breast cancer cell lines screened with 90 FDA-approved drugs (CellTiter-Glo pharmacological assay, Supplemen-tary Table 1),  with eight compounds in common with CCLE and GDSC (Sup- plementary Fig., 15). To check the predictive value of our biomarkers in breast cancer we fitted the linear models in Eqs., ( 13) using only breast cancer cell lines in our training sets (61 and 54 breast cancer cell lines in CCLE and GDSC, respectively)., A biomarker is selected if its predictive value in breast cancer celllines is >0.55. To validate the selected biomarkers in GRAY we computed the significance of the linear association between the biomarker expression and drug response (unadjusted p-value <0.05) with the same direction of association (sign of the coef ficient ) as the training sets., To select the validated biomarkers whose isoform expression is signi ficantly more predictive than the corresponding overall gene expression, we estimated the concordance index distribution of the isoform-based and gene-based models using the bootstrap procedure and compared these distributions using a two-sided Wilcoxon-signed rank test (Supplementary Fig., 13). Final validation of isoform-based biomarkers . To test whether the predictive value of the isoform-based biomarkers validated in GRAY was robust to the use of a different pharmacological assay, we leveraged a collection of 84 breast cancer cell lines recently used to investigate gene essentiality in breast cancer molecularsubtypes 21., We selected 14 cell lines in this collection that were readily available and showed extreme expressions of the biomarkers of interest (Supplementary Table 1)., Selected cell lines were cultured and screened for their response to three targeted agents lapatinib,  AZD6244 and erlotinib,  and one chemotherapy,  pacli- taxel., We used the sulforhodamine B colorimetric (SRB) proliferation assay60in 96well plates to determine the drug dose response curves., We subtracted the average phosphate-buffer saline (PBS) wells value from all wells and computed the standard deviation and coef ficient for each triplicate., Data points with coef ficient or standard deviation >0.2 were discarded. All the individual treated well values were normalized to the control well values. We used the PharmacoGx50package to fit the curves using a logarithmic logistic regression method to estimate the AUC sensitivity values., Raw and processed pharmacological data are available through our PharmacoGx platform under the UHNBC PharmacoSet., Code availability .
