Previously published prognostic models were developed from a small number of samples that lacked proper vali- dation in multiple data sets.17-21Attempts have been made recently to build a prognostic gene signature using pooledsamples from multiple cohorts to identify patients who areat high risk of short-term survival postsurgery., 22-24However they used samples that were pro filed using either an array- or sequencing-based method as the learning cohort, therefore, the classi fiers may perform better for patients whose samples were pro filed using only one of the two platforms., To address these issues we took advantage of a unique set of 89 PDACs that were pro filed using both microarray and sequencing technologies to develop the Pancreatic CancerOverall Survival Predictor (PCOSP) model., Using an in-dependent set of PDAC transcriptomic pro files from 823 primary resected patients we show that PCOSP is a robust single-sample predictor of early death 1 year or less  after surgery that could be used as a potential tool to assistclinicians in decision making., MATERIALS AND METHODS The meta-analysis pipeline used to develop the PCOSP model and evaluate its prognostic value is provided inFigure 1 ., Data Sets We surveyed the literatur e and curated 17 data sets which included 1, 236 patients with PDAC, from the public domain for which transcriptome data of PDAC were available (Data Supplement)., We further filtered samples on the basis of the availability of overall survival(OS) and sample size (n = 10 or greater) data after di- chotomization into high-and low-survival groups on theb a s i so fa nO Sc u t o f fo f1y e a r( Fig 2 )., The different cohorts had similar clinical presentation and were treatedwith curative surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (Data Supplement).Prognostic Model To develop a robust predictor for early death, we used gene expression pro files of 89 samples from patients with PDAC whose tumors had been pro filed using both microarray and sequencing platforms within the International Cancer Ge-nome Consortium (ICGC) cohort., Human research ethicalapproval was granted as previously published. 14Approxi- mately one half of patients of the training cohort who wereeligible for surgery experienced relapse within 1 year, weused this threshold to predict which patients with PDAChad high risk of early death 1 year or less postsurgery., We excluded seven samples from the training cohort as these patients were censored before 1 year of follow-up., To make gene expression pro files comparable between the training and validation sets we transformed the original gene expression pro files into binary gene pair barcodes., We implemented k-Top scoring disjoint pairs classi fier pre- dictor 25using the Wilcoxon rank sum method as a filtering function in the SwitchBox package (version 1.12.0)26(Data Supplement)., To assess whether the prognostic value of thePCOSP model could be achieved by random chance alone we tested two permutation tests (Data Supplement)., Early Death Prediction Meta-analysis was performed for the PDAC sequencing cohorts PDAC array-based cohorts, and overall combinedcohorts to assess and statistically compare the perfor-mance of the PCOSP., Patient samples were dichotomizedinto two groups on the basis of the outcome variable time from surgery to death of 1 year or less., Samples censoredbefore 1 year of follow-up were excluded from the analysis of the meta-estimate of the area under the receiver oper- ating characteristics curve (AUROC)., AUROC plots thesensitivity versus 1-Speci ficity and is used as a criterion with which to measure the discriminatory ability of the model., 27 AUROC was computed using pROC package (version 1.10.0) and we estimated the Pvalue using the Mann-Whitney test statistics that estimated whether the AUROC curveCONTEXT Key Objective Building a robust molecular predictor model to stratify patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) on the basis of risk of early death., Knowledge GeneratedWe generated a compendium of 17 PDAC data sets including 1, 236 gene expression pro files and 823 patients with survival data, as a resource for future PDAC analyses., We built the Pancreatic Cancer Overall Survival Predictor (PCOSP) a single- sample prognostic model robust to heterogeneous gene expression pro filing platform and normalization methods for identifying patients with PDAC who are at high risk of early death., RelevanceEndoscopic ultrasound biopsies could be used before curative surgery to estimate the prognosis of patients with PDAC using PCOSP to assist clinicians in predicting high-risk patients and making treatment decisions for this population.Sandhu et al 2 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology Downloaded from ascopubs.org by University Health Network on November 20, 2023 from 205.189.058.093 Copyright  2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology., All rights reserved. estimate is signi ficantly different from 0.5 (random clas- sifier). The meta-estimate of AUROC was estimated using the random effect model28implemented in survcomp package (version 1.26.0).29, 30 Survival Prediction Prognostic value and statistical signi ficance of survival difference between the predicted classes were assessedusing the D-Index, which is a robust estimate of the tra- ditional Cox hazard ratio (HR)., The main advantage of D-index compared with HR is a result of the fact that it is a robust and interpretable scale-free measure of separationbetween two independent survival distributions under theproportional hazards assumption., 31This makes D-indexa suitable estimate of prognostic value in a meta-analysis setting in which the heterogeneity of different cohorts mustbe accounted for., In addition we used the concordanceindex (C-index),  which estimates the probability that, fora random pair of patients, the PCOSP score for the patientwith shorter survival is higher than that of the patient with longer survival., 32Both the D-index and C-index were calcu- lated using the survcomp package. We calculated the meta-estimate of the D-index and C-index for the PDAC sequencing cohorts the PDAC array-based cohorts, and the combinedPDAC sequencing and array-based cohorts using the randomeffect model 28implemented in the survcomp package., Pa- tients were strati fied into low- and high-risk groups using median PCOSP score as a threshold.

Prognostic Relevance of the PCOSP Model To assess the prognostic value of the PCOSP model we calculated the C-index and D-index using OS data for all cohorts., The C-index is signi ficant overall (C-index, 0.63; P = 1.8E 12;Fig 3B ). In agreement with results of early death prediction the PCOSP prognostic value was higher for thesequencing data sets compared with arrays (C-index, 0.65, P, 3.8E14vC-index,  0.61,  P, 1.6E12,  respectively,  Fig 3B )., Similar to the C-index PCOSP D-index was strong and signi ficant overall ( D-index,  1.95, P= 1.4E 04, Fig 3C ) and stronger for the sequencing data sets ( D-index,  2.24 v 1.83,  Fig 3C )., To assess whether the prognostic value of PCOSP depends on PDAC molecular subtypes we strati-fied PDAC samples into basal and classic subtypes using the Mof fitt classi fier 13and calculated meta-estimates of C-index and D-index., We found that PCOSP was prognostic in validation cohorts independent of molecular subtypes (Appendix Figs A2A and A2B )., We further assessed whether PCOSP prognostic value was complementary toclinicopathologic parameters and molecular subtypes byfitting both a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model to predict survival and a logistic regression model to predictbinary outcome death at less than 1 year or not (Data Supplement)., To further illustrate the prognostic value of PCOSP we strati fied patients into low- and high-risk groups and plotted Kaplan-Meier curves for each cohort ( Figs 4A-4J )., OS was signi ficantly different between risk groups for all se- quencing cohorts and two microarray cohorts ( P, .05) and borderline signi ficant for three microarray cohorts (.05  P, .10, Figs 4A-4J ), with a 10-month difference in median OS between risk groups., Clinicopathologic Model to Predict OSThe logistic regression model fitted using these clinico- pathologic features was used to predict early death ofpatients with PDAC., The clinicopathologic model was notsigni ficant overall (C-index, 0.55; P= .17; Fig 5A ). In contrast to PCOSP the clinicopathologic model was notpredictive in the sequencing cohort (C-index, 0.53 and 0.58 with P= .75 and .05 for the sequencing and array data sets,  respectively, Fig 5A )., Only nodal status tumor grade, and molecular classes were signi ficant in the univariable analysis (Data Supplement)., We compared the prognosticvalue of the clinicopathologic model with PCOSP ( Figs 5B and 5C ). PCOSP was signi ficantly more prognostic than the clinicopathologic model (one-sided ttest P, .01, Fig 5D )., Comparison With Published Prognostic ModelsWe compared the prognostic value of PCOSP with three published PDAC prognostic models, referred to as Birn-baum,  22Chen, 23and Haider.24Overall prognostic value of the three published models was signi ficant ( Figs 6A and 6C)., PCOSP signi ficantly outperformed published prog- nostic models in all cases ( P.05, Figs 6C and 6D ), with the exception of the D-index of the Chen classi fier where thesuperiority of the PCOSP prognostic value demonstrated a trend to signi ficance (one-sided ttest, P= .10)., Pathway Analysis of Prognostic Genes Gene enrichment analysis for PCOSP signature genes (n = 1 070) found that the extracellular matrix (ECM),  epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), and hedgehog signaling pathway genes were enriched in the PCOSPmodel at false-discovery rate of less than 5% (DataSupplement)., DISCUSSION We performed a meta-analysis of the transcriptomic pro files of 1 236 patients with PDAC and developed the PCOSP, a new prognostic model with which to identify patients whoare at high risk of early death after surgery., The model isbuilt from a unique set of 89 patients pro filed using both array-based and sequencing platforms and validated ona compendium of 10 independent data sets that included823 patients., The prognostic value of the PCOSP modelwas highly signi ficant for both early death 1 year or lessand OS ( P, .001,  Fig 3 )., Contrary to published prognostic signatures that were fitted on a small number of samples and that lack validation inlarge independent data sets, 17-21PCOSP has been trained and validated on a large compendium of data sets., Com-parison of PCOSP with existing classi fiers 22-24demon- strated that the Birnbaum Chen, and Haider modelsyielded signi ficant but signi ficantly weaker prognostic value than PCOSP ( Figs 6C and 6D )., Of importance PCOSP performs signi ficantly better than existing classi fiers for both microarray and sequencing platforms, likely becauseof simplifying the continuous expression space into binarypair barcodes., This enables PCOSP to be used as a singlesample predictor robust to pro filing platforms potential batch effects,  and normalization methods compared withother classi fiers., Comparison of PCOSP against known prognostic clinico- pathologic variables demonstrated that PCOSP out- performed the clinicopathologic model in predicting early death ( Fig 5 )., PCOSP prognostic value was signi ficant even after adjusting for molecular subtyping (classic vbasal) and clinicopathologic parameters (age, sex,  TNM status,  dif-ferentiation grade of tumor,  and molecular classes, Ap-pendix Figs A2A and A2B and Data Supplement)., The PCOSP model incorporates 2,619 unique gene pairs, totaling 1,070 unique genes. Functional analysis of 1 070 genes demonstrated enrichment of Hedgehog signaling and ECM and EMT pathways., Numerous studies havesuggested the involvement of EMT in the invasion andmetastasis of PDAC. 42EMT enhances cell motility via loss of cellcell adhesion escaping from the ECM and overcoming the apoptosis process.42The ECM and EMT pathways are not only associated with the metastatic spread of tumor butalso with chemoresistance, which leads to worse survival., 43Sandhu et al 6 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology Downloaded from ascopubs.org by University Health Network on November 20, 2023 from 205.189.058.093 Copyright  2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology., All rights reserved. PDAC is a heterogeneous and genetically highly com- plex disease which supports the molecular13, 14and morphologic44characterization of a given tumor as an important cornerstone for the development of futuretherapies., We provide the largest compendium of 17 PDACdata sets as a gold standard for future PDAC analyses. Thenew meta-analysis framework implemented in PCOSP maximizes robustness and performance across cohorts., To implement PCOSP as a clinical assay we tested differentfeature set sizes for the k-Top scoring disjoint pairs modelsand compared the performance of the reduced models., Weachieved accuracy that was comparable to the 1 070-genePCOSP model by including only 256 unique genes, whichsupports the potential for the implementation of a smallerPCOSP-like modelfor the clinic setting (Appendix Fig A3 ).Endoscopic ultrasound biopsies could be used before curative surgery to estimate the prognosis of patients with PDAC using PCOSP., This may assist clinicians in the se- lection of patients for surgery and help to identify those patients with high-risk progressive disease for whom anoperation has little oncologic bene fit., The current study has potential limitations.

ICGC, OUH, Zhang, and Winter data sets used bulk tumors for pro filing. Second transcriptomic pro files in our data compendium were generated using different gene ex- pression pro filing technologies for sequencing (Illumina HiSEquation 2000/2500, Illumina,  San Diego,  CA) and microarray platforms (Agilent Technologies,  Santa Clara,  CA, Affymetrix,  Santa Clara,  CA,  and Illumina)., Third allsamples were normalized using the published processing methods, which depend on the pro filing platforms (Data Supplement)., Fourth there may be a loss of informationwith regard to the coexpression and magnitude of differ-ential expression between genes by converting expression data into binary barcodes information., However there arestatistical bene fits to the binary barcodes approach over predictions that are based on continuous gene expressiondata., The binary barcode approach produces single- sample predictions that are insensitive to monotonic transformation of the gene expression data, which is par-ticularly relevant in the meta-analysis of heterogeneouscohorts in which continuous gene expression based pre- diction approaches need scaling of data for comparisonacross cohorts., Despite these limitations PCOSP yielded robust prognostic value across the heterogeneous data sets, indicating that the gene expression barcode transformation is robust to the inevitable biases that are present in large meta-analyses., FIG 5.

However exploring other factors,  such as germline vari- ants,  epigenetics, copy number alterations,  noncodingRNAs, protein abundance and epidemiologic and envi-ronmental factors, will be necessary to further improve theprediction accuracy of predictive models., Lack of available clinical and treatment information across cohorts is also a limiting factor in our meta-analysis, whichprevents us from investigating this source of heterogeneityfurther., However comparison of cohort-speci fic clinical information for the cohort was not signi ficantly different across cohorts (Data Supplement)., During the time periodof sample collection standard-of-care treatment of PDACwas curative-intent surgery followed by adjuvant chemo-therapy with gemcitabine or fluorouracil., New approaches using doublet and triplet chemotherapy regimens are nowbecoming standard of care in the adjuvant setting., 45The survival bene fit observed with FOLFIRINOX (folinic acidfluorouracil,  irinotecan, oxaliplatin) in the adjuvant setting highlights the importance of systemic therapy in curingpatients with resectable PDAC., The role of neoadjuvantchemotherapy is also being evaluated in many centersthus, heterogeneity in treatment is expected within andbetween different cohorts., We will need to test our PCOSP model using new clinical data sets or preferably within the context of randomized trials., In conclusion we leveraged the largest compendium of PDAC transcriptomes to develop PCOSP, a prognostic model that identi fies patients with PDAC at high risk of early death independent of, and superior to,  clinicopathologicfeatures and molecular subtypes., PCOSP may be useful inthe clinical setting as a single sample classi fier to identify patients who could be at higher risk of early death aftersurgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, potentially facilitatingtreatment decisions., AFFILIATIONS 1University Health Network Toronto,  Ontario,  Canada 2Oslo University Hospital, Institute for Cancer Research,  Oslo,  Norway 3Oslo University Hospital,  Oslo, Norway 4Mount Sinai Hospital,  Toronto,  Ontario,  Canada 5Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto,  Ontario,  Canada 6University of South-Eastern Norway,  B in Telemark, Norway 7University of Toronto,  Toronto,  Ontario,  Canada Preprint version available on bioRxiv ., CORRESPONDING AUTHOR Benjamin Haibe-Kains PhD,  University of Toronto,  101 College St, PMCRT 11-310,  M5G1L7,  Toronto,  ON M5G1L7,  Canada,  Twitter,  @bhaibeka,  @OICR_news,  @UHN, e-mail,  bhaibeka@uhnresearch.ca., SUPPORT Supported by the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (OICR PanCuRx Translational Research Initiative) through funding provided by theGovernment of Ontario, and a charitable donation from the CanadianFriends of the Hebrew University (Alex U.

APPENDIX MATERIALS AND METHODS Data Sets We surveyed the literature and curated 17 data sets that included 1, 236 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) fromthe public domain for which transcriptome data of PDAC wereavailable., We filtered samples on the basis of the availability of overall survival (OS) and sample size ( .10) after dichotomization into high- and low-survival groups on the basis of an OS cutoff of 1 year., Thisresulted in a total of four sequencing studies and seven array-basedstudies providing transcriptomic and clinical data for 1, 001 patientswith PDAC., A total of 12 430 protein-coding genes commonlyassessed across all cohorts were used for additional analysis., Prognostic Model Decision rules are based on the relative ordering of gene expression values within the same sample in which the k-Top scoring gene pairs are used to build the classi fier., Samples were resampled 1000 times, where 40 samples from each group were selected in each run to builda k-Top scoring disjoint pair (k-TSP) model, and the model was furthertested on the 49 out-of-bag samples., Models were selected if thebalanced accuracy was greater than 0.6 or the model was rejected. Wethen froze the parameters of the predictive model and validated it in theremaining compendium of independent data sets., The class proba-bility of the sample was calculated as the frequency of the samplepredicted as one class divided by the total number of models., Ad-vantages of considering pairs of genes with a binary value 1ifexpression of gene i.gene j 0otherwise are as follows, it transforms the feature space in a way that mitigates platform biasesand potential batch effects and it makes the model robust to any dataprocessing that preserves gene order (Patil P, et al,  Bioinformatics 31, 2318-2323,  2015,  Eddy JA,  et al,  Technol Cancer Res Treat 9, 149-159,  2010)., Random Classi fier To assess whether gene expression pro files were associated with survival we shuf fled the actual class labels while maintaining the expression values., To test whether the gene pairs selected in thePancreatic Cancer Overall Survival Predictor (PCOSP) model wererobustly associated with survival, we randomly assigned genes to thek-TSP model and assessed its prognostic value., Both procedures wereperformed 1,000 times. As a prevalidation set we compared thebalanced accuracy of all 1, 000 random models generated using bothapproaches to PCOSP using the Wilcoxon rank sum test., Furthermore we trained the k-TSP classi fier models from both approaches in the same way as we built our consensus PCOSP model., We then froze theparameters of the prognostic model and validated it in the compen-dium of independent data sets and compared meta-estimates for bothmodels against the PCOSP model., Subtyping of PDAC Cohorts PDAC cohorts were classi fied into basal and classic transcriptomic subtypes using the Mof fitt classi fier.13 We calculated the meta- estimates of C-index and hazard ratio for PDAC subtypes using therandom effect model implemented in survcomp package in RSchroder et al, Bioinformatics 27,  3206-8,  2011., A1.

      "question": "Are there any contradictions between this paper's findings and previous research?",
      "answer": "The findings of the paper \"Meta-Analysis of 1,200 Transcriptomic Profiles Identifies a Prognostic Model for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma\" (Sandhu et al., 2019) do present some contradictions with previous research. \n\n1. **Prognostic Model Development**: The authors highlight that previous prognostic models were developed from a limited number of samples and lacked validation across multiple datasets. This contrasts with their approach, which utilized a larger compendium of 1,236 patients and validated their Pancreatic Cancer Overall Survival Predictor (PCOSP) model across 10 independent datasets. This suggests that earlier models may have been less reliable due to their smaller sample sizes and lack of robust validation.\n\n2. **Comparison with Existing Classifiers**: The paper states that the PCOSP model significantly outperformed existing prognostic models (such as those by Birnbaum, Chen, and Haider) in terms of prognostic value. This indicates a contradiction with the findings of those earlier studies, which may have suggested that their models were adequate for predicting outcomes in PDAC patients. The authors assert that PCOSP's performance was superior, particularly in its ability to predict early death and overall survival, which challenges the validity of the previous models.\n\n3. **Clinical Variables vs. Molecular Profiling**: The authors argue that while various clinical factors (like lymph node metastasis, tumor grade, etc.) have been considered prognostic after PDAC surgery, their prognostic value is insufficient for accurately stratifying patients based on the risk of disease recurrence. This contrasts with prior research that may have placed significant emphasis on these clinical variables as reliable prognostic indicators.\n\n4. **Platform Bias and Batch Effects**: The paper discusses the limitations of previous studies that used either microarray or sequencing data without addressing platform biases. The authors claim that their binary gene pair method allows for a more robust analysis that is less affected by these biases, which may contradict findings from earlier studies that did not account for such variability.\n\nIn summary, the paper presents a more comprehensive and validated prognostic model for PDAC that contradicts previous research by emphasizing the limitations of earlier models, the inadequacy of clinical variables alone, and the importance of addressing platform biases in transcriptomic profiling."
