Such dependencies demonstrate that their application is highly dependent on the careful selection of a nominal voxel size and the number of intensity bins [16] (1), [17],  [18]., For instance the type of binning and number of bins significantly affected radiomic parameters extracted from coronary artery plaques [19]., In other words post-processing settings, such as bin size in intensity normalization or voxel size in voxel rescaling, should be adjusted based on the type of radiomic feature,  imaging parameter, organ and clinical outcome., In addition the numerical values of radio - mic features were highly correlated with tumor volume and voxel resampling was not sufficient to remove this correlation [16]., One can eliminate this dependency only by including the number of voxels in feature definitions (i.e., feature normalization) [12]., One possible so- lution would be to focus on the imaging parameters that disturb the robustness of radiomic features., We refer to these imaging parameters as disruptive parameters (DP). Having known these parameters, we must select the radiomics features robust to them. However, this action re- quires deep knowledge about these DPs and their related robust features. In this review we collected a list of disruptive (DP) and non-disruptive (nDP) parameters associated with radiomic features extracted from CT images., 2.Materials and methods 2.1. Literature search Our literature search was conducted using PubMed and included all publications from February 2021 or earlier., Publications included in our review met all of the following inclusion criteria (1) publications must be peer-reviewed English full-text reports, (2) have radiomics features extracted from CT images, and (3) focus on the robustness of radiomic features resulting from variation in scanner manufacturer, imaging acquisition or reconstruction parameters., We used the following search words (Radiomics OR Texture) AND (Reproducibility OR Robustness OR Stability) AND (CT OR CT Scan OR Computed Tomography) speci - fied in the search string., Furthermore, we excluded repeatability or test- retest studies. We also screened the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for any previous systematic reviews addressing the robustness of CT-based radiomic features., For all the articles obtained where we used the full text for data extraction we screened the bibliographic references within them for potentially eligible studies., The researchers downloaded these electronic full-text articles using university library subscriptions., 2.2. Data extraction We extracted information including the subject (patient or phan - tom) the type of organ, the clinical implications for human studies and the type of phantom for phantom studies., We noted the study type (retrospective or prospective) as well as any image acquisition and reconstruction parameters explicitly stated in the text., We also recorded the total number of radiomic features tested and reported these features according to the following well known feature groups, Shape features,  First Order Statistics (FO),  higher-order textural features (GLCM,  RLM,  GLSZM, GLDZM,  NGTDM,  NGLDM)., A complete list of the abbreviations used in this article has been presented in Supplementary Table 1., We also classified features based on 2D or 3D extraction. In addition we also recorded the details of the software used to quantitatively extract radiomic features, as well as the statistical method(s) used to report feature robustness., Reporting complies with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standards [20]., 3.Results The PubMed search yielded 206 abstracts including 31 eligible studies that reported the impact of imaging parameters on the robust - ness of radiomic features extracted from CT images., We also included the full text for 16 papers located in the references of retrieved studies (Fig. 1). Finally we derived in-depth evaluation on 47 studies, of which 30 human studies and 15 phantom studies and 2 studies worked on both patient and phantom data., The vast majority of human studies addressed the robustness of CT-based radiomic features in lungs (51.3%) (Fig., 2A). All prospective studies used different types of physical phantoms. Amongst the prospective phantom studies Credence Cartridge Radio - mics (CCR) Phantom developed by Mackin [14] was the most common type of phantom used (41.2%) (Fig., 2B). 3.1. Disruptive parameters We grouped the disruptive parameters into 3 classes (i) scanner (studies that only focused on the effect of different CT scanners dis- regarding any specific acquisition or reconstruction parameter), (ii) acquisition (including patient-related parameters),  and (iii) reconstruction., Scanner was evaluated in 10 studies (7 phantom and 3 patient studies) (Supplementary Table 2). In these studies different scanners with various image acquisition and reconstruction settings were used to mimic routine imaging protocols [14]., In 8 [1014, 17, 2125] studies,  applying different feature extraction software, evaluation metrics and features,  CT scanner was found as a disruptive parameter (Fig., 3). It is noteworthy to mention that different CT scanners have been proven to have variation in their Hounsfield units even with the same acquisition parameters [22, 26]., Perrin et al. showed that utilizing images from different scanners reduced the number of liver tumor-derived robust features (CCCF0.9) from 75 to 35 (out of 254) [27]., However, Mackin et al. reported that variations of radiomic features among different scanners were found to be similar to their variation among 20 Non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients stating Business-NGTDM and strength-NGTDM the most and least robust fea- tures respectively [14]., Acquisition parameters including exposure respiratory motion,  contrast agent administration, tube voltage and pitch were evaluated in 34 studies using phantom (13), patient (19) or both types of data (2) either alone or in combination with other parameters (i.e., reconstruc - tion and scanner) (Supplementary Table 2). Exposure in 9 [921, 23, 24,  2832] vs. 6 [10, 17, 26, 3335], respiratory motion in 6 [3641] vs none,  contrast agent in 4 [10, 27, 34, 42] vs. 1 [43] and tube voltage in 3 [21, 23, 24]vs. none were respectively reported as the most and least disruptive parameters for radiomic features (Fig., 3). Pitch was the only image acquisition parameter that was reported as a nDPs in all the corre - sponding studies [24, 26, 36]., In some studies respiratory motion was not explicitly evaluated and instead the superiority of using average intensity projection images for radiomic studies over those taken with free-breathing has been shown [40]., Using scans at the end of the exhalation phase of a 4DCT acquisition [11] has been shown to yield more robust radiomics features (CCC F0.85)., Another study stated the considerable impact of respiration on feature robustness and they sug- gested applying 4D stability as a feature selection to reduce feature variability [37]., The reviewed studies reported Shape features [37 40] and Short-Run Emphasis [39] as the Radiomic features most robust to respiration., Although 4D features were more robust there was no sig- nificant correlation between feature robustness and prognostic value In R.

One study [46] investigated the effect on the noise index resulting from recon - struction algorithms and it was found to be a nDP., 3.2. Inconsistencies The selected studies suffer from the following variations in their methodology Software details (application framework used for feature extraction,  programming language, and version) varied significantly across the reviewed studies (Fig., 2C). The majority of studies described their software as in-house software mostly based on MATLAB  (The Math - Works, Natick,  MA) [58],  PyRadiomics (Python) [59] and IBEX (MATLAB) [60]., Different software platforms have also shown a sig- nificant effect on the statistical variation of Radiomic features [61]., The current literature varied with regards to the optimal metric to use for analysis. The metrics encountered were the CCC in 32.6% of studies, COV in 21.7% and ICC in 17.4% of studies. 28.3% of studies used other metrics such as variability index interquartile range, pro- portional difference,  absolute difference,  or linear mixed-effects models., Some studies reported more than a single metric [24]. Nevertheless One study reported that there is no statistically significant difference when using either the CCC or the ICC metric [62]., The specific cut off values used to segregate stable from unstable features were not always stated and some studies just reported the percentage of robust features with different cut off values regardless of which cut off value was suitable., Among studies that used the CCC and/or ICC metric, the most common cut off values were 0.9. For COV, cut off values included 1%,5%,10% and 20%. Also the clustering-based metrics have some limited usage such as the Gaussian mixture model homogeneity, completeness,  and the V-measure [15]., However another study found that the choice of metric as well as the threshold influenced the results [24]., Across the papers analyzed for this study there was heterogeneity in the total number of features calculated,  the type of features, and the feature dimensions., The range of the total number of features was from 5 [25] to 1766 [36] and the majority fell between D100 (~43%) (Fig., 2E). FO, GLCM, RLM and Shape features were the most common feature types used. One ambiguity in the feature calculations was the feature dimension. However in 62.2% and 17.8% of studies 3D and 2D features (including averaging 2D features over the slices that cover the segmented ROI instead of real 3D calculation) were used respectively (Fig., 2F). Also 20% of studies did not disclose the information regarding feature dimension. A study compared a shape feature and FO features computed from 2D and 3D images and found that the 3D features were more robust than the 2D features across all imaging parameters [7]., 4.Discussion This review investigates the robustness of hand-engineered radiomic features in the context of varying imaging parameters through a deep- dive literature review., In order to make this feasible imaging parame - ters,  which affect the feature robustness, were collected and grouped into the disruptive and non-disruptive parameters., Overall the number of studies addressing the impacts of CT imaging parameters on the robustness of radiomic features is low with the most of these studies being either phantom or retrospective human studies., Although phantom studies are a good guide for conducting prospective studies the applicability of these studies is limited because of the inherent significant difference between phantom material and human tissue., Even features that we acquired under similar acquisition condi - tions (such as uniform water phantom) are different from human tissues [31]., Moreover, there is a lack of comprehensive prospective human studies. This is particularly true with respect to investigating the effects of image acquisition parameters. This is due to an inability to rescan patients in the absence of a clinical indication. The drawbacks of the retrospective studies are that the investigators did not have control over the parameters studied, and the range of the scan acquisition parameter variations were limited to those used in imaging patients., We also aimed to collect a list of robust features along with the most and least disruptive parameters., We reasoned that the resulting list could help future radiomics studies. A comparison study showed that the prognostic CT radiomics model to predict overall survival for locally advanced NSCLC patients based on heterogeneous multicentric dataset with robust features performed equally well as a model trained on a standardized imaging protocol [45]., In another study the hierarchical cluster analysis which enables the classification of liver lesions with similar radiomic features, showed improved clustering reproducibility when robust radiomic features were used compared with all radiomic features [50]., However this review is unable to provide such a list due to the substantial inconsistencies related to the reporting style of the reviewed studies., We found that the most common approach to reporting the robust features were the percent of robust features, the robust features against all the imaging parameters and the robust feature-parameter that determine which features are robust against which parameter(s)., Nevertheless Shape [7, 24, 25, 46, 51] and FO [11,  24, 31, 35] features were the most reported robust feature classes across the reviewed papers (Supplementary Table 2)., We attribute such find- ings to the fact that features rely on the segmented tumor boundaries or alternatively,  features have low-frequency change components,  such as shape., In one study, GLRLM was found to be robust against the recon - struction algorithm [19]. Other studies reported some features indi- vidually against specific imaging parameters GLSZM-SAE (slice thickness) [17],  GLRLM-SRE (respiratory motion) [39], GLCM-dissimilarity (slice thickness),  FO-Kurtosis,  LGRE(exposure), FO-Correlation (reconstruction algorithm) [30],  GLRLM-nonuniformity (respiratory motion), GLCM-sumAverage(slice thickness) [5]., The lack of discussion on the clinical implication of feature robust - ness is another shortfall of the available studies., In a study [52] for predicting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation in lung adenocarcinoma patients, it was concluded that an imaging dataset with uniform imaging parameters is considerably more efficient than Fig., 3.Distribution of disruptive (DP) and non-disruptive (nDP) parameters reported.

As shown in previous sections the robustness of radiomic features depends on the imaging parameters as well., It means global pre-processing settings would not be effective in removing dependencies for all imaging parameters., Two desirable but less practical solutions of reducing the de- pendency of radiomic features on imaging parameters are (i) cre- dentialing CT scanners used in radiomics studies or correcting for the parameters of the scanner during data analysis, and (ii) adopting stan- dardized image acquisition and reconstruction parameters as is stated by a recent statement of the European Society of Radiology [67]., Recently a statistical harmonization method called ComBat was used in radiomics studies to deal with the impact of imaging parameters [68] by empirical Bayes estimation of prior distribution hyperparameters from standard - ized features and subsequent estimation of batch effect parameters., However ComBat fits a model for a specific set of data (standardized features) to transform the data and make them more comparable., Once this is done the same transformation is not applicable to brand new data from a new imaging center where the correct transformation might be different and must be learned., Providing availability of reliable statis - tical approach the most practical way to address the effect of variation in imaging parameters would be using selected reproducible radiomic features [50]., In the meantime, deep learning may allow the use of heterogeneous CT datasets for radiomics studies. In a study CNN model was developed to convert reconstruction kernels and were subsequently able to show improved feature robustness [11]., Another study used a neural network and adversarial training to reduce the disruptive effect of scanner and acquisition parameters on image markers by feature transformation [15]., 5.Conclusion Radiomic features stand to play an important role in guiding personalized cancer treatment., However the robustness of these fea- tures against variation in medical imaging parameters may affect the performance of the models built upon these features., We concluded that based on the available literature, radiomics features are dependent on imaging parameters., Nevertheless, the impact of this dependency must be evaluated on the prediction of clinical outcome. We have also concluded that there are discrepancies in methodology across the available studies imposing the need for comprehensive studies to further investigate the effects of imaging parameters., We would also suggest establishing a universal methodology and reporting styles in radiomics studies that would make researchers  work more reproducible and create consistency within the scientific community., Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper., Acknowledgments Research reported in this paper was supported by the Princess Margaret Cancer Foundation and Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), Canada under grant number,  426366., Appendix A.Supplementary data Supplementary data to this article can be found online at https://doi. org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104400 .
