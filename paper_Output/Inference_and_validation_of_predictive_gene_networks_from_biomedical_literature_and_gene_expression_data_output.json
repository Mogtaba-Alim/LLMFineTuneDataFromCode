NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript Keywords Network Inference, Quantitative Validation,  Gene Expression,  Targeted Perturbations 1., Introduction/Methods We have increasingly come to recognize that cellular regulatory processes are more complex than we had once imagined and that it is generally not individual genes, but networks of interacting genes and gene products, which collectively interact to define phenotypes and the alterations that occur in the development of a disease [4]., The first application of network reconstruction to gene expression used data from a yeast cell cycle experiment in which synchronized cells were profiled over a carefully planned time-course [28]., Friedman and colleagues analyzed these data in a Bayesian Network framework to develop a predictive cell-cycle model., Since this early work there have been many other methods developed to model networks while addressing the intrinsic complexity of high-throughput genomic data (high feature-to-sample ratio and high level of noise) [22]., However few methods have been widely used and often fail to produce useful network models, mainly because there are no gold standards on how to build and validate large gene networks [12, 35]., One challenge in developing network inference methods is validation of the resulting models. Most published network inference methods attempt to validate their models through comparison with biological databases, calculating the proportion of interactions found both in the inferred networks and those databases [2]., However this assumes that the network topologies are static and do not change between phenotypes or in response to perturbations., Others have validated small network models using targeted biological experiments to assess interactions between genes, but this is not feasible for a large number of genes and new potential interactions., An alternate route based on simulated interventional data was used in the NIPS2008 workshop on causality validating inferred networks by trying to predict the results of interventions [16], but this method is biased to those network inference models most closely resembling the simulation model., Here we propose a new validation framework that enables a quantitative and unbiased assessment of the performance of an inferred network model., This framework relies on generating independent single-gene knock-down experiments targeting a collection of genes in a network or pathway of interest, and measuring gene expression data before and after the knockdowns., With this data in hand we apply the following iterative leave-one-out cross- validation approach to assess the performance of a given network inference method (Fig., 1) 1.Select a single gene knock-down,  including all replicates, from the collection as validation set., 2.From the remaining knock-down experiments, build a predictive network model. 3.Use the validation set to assess the networks quality focused on connections local to the perturbation., 4.Repeat steps 13 until all perturbations have been tested in the models and their local predictive power assessed.Olsen et al., Page 2 Genomics . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 May 01. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript This dual use of the data for model inference and validation allows the computation of a performance score that quantitatively assesses the inferred networks quality based on a comparison between the genes that are empirically determined to be affected based on the validation data set and those genes inferred to be affected based on the models., Since this validation framework is not tied to a specific network inference method it can be used to assess the relative performance of different network inference methods., As a test of the approach we applied it to two methods that infer directed (causal) interaction network from gene expression data, GeneNet [27] and predictionet [17]., GeneNet computes full partial correlations and then orders the genes based on partial variances to identify directed acyclic causal networks., This approach improves on Bayesian network inference methods as it allows inference of large interaction networks containing hundreds of genes., However its current implementation (version 1.2.5) does not integrate prior knowledge about likely network structure captured in published biomedical literature and pathway databases [9, 14,  18,  32]., Bayesian networks are inferred from different sources of information in [19 29, 32] but to the best of our knowledge there is no such method publicly available in R. The use of prior network structures is at the heart of predictionet , which builds on reported gene-gene interactions cataloged in the Predictive Networks (PN), web application [17]., predictionet infers an undirected network using mRMR (minimum Redundancy-Maximum Relevance [8, 26]) feature selection and then orients the edges in this network using the interaction information [25]., In both steps prior information can be used to adjust the respective rankings based on the confidence in the interactions, as further described in Section 1.1 of the Supplementary Information., Here we will describe the application of our validation framework which combines knock- down experiments and network inference, to quantitatively assess inference methods for large gene interaction networks., We will show that the integration of priors with gene expression data yielded networks best at predicting the genes affected by a targeted perturbation., 2. Results In this section we will present our validation framework and the combination of targeted perturbations and network inference methods it relies on., The data and the main parameters used in our framework will be described in detail. 2.1. Targeted perturbations One of the best approaches to test the quality of a network model is to quantify how well it can predict the systems response to perturbations., As a demonstration we use a well- studied model system - the RAS signaling pathway in colorectal cancer., We performed RNAi-mediated gene knockdown experiments in two colorectal cancer cell lines SW480 and SW620 [20],  targeting eight key genes in the RAS pathway,  CDK5,  HRAS,  MAP2K1, MAP2K2,  MAPK1,  MAPK3,  NGFR and RAF11., The experiments were done in six biological replicates of each knockdown and controls in both cell lines., From each sample, 1http://www.biocarta.com/pathfiles/h_wntPathway.aspOlsen et al. Page 3 Genomics . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 May 01. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript we profiled gene expression (Supplementary File 1) using the A ymetrix GeneChip HG- U133PLUS2 platform., CEL files were normalized using frma [24]. We used the jetset package to select a unique probeset for each of the 19 218 unique gene symbols represented on the arrays, further annotations were obtained using biomaRt [11]., The raw and normalized data are available from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository [5] with accession number GSE53091., A more detailed description of the knock-down experiments is available in Section 1.6 in Supplementary Information., Although our experimental perturbations were limited to eight genes the goal was to infer a larger network., Consequently, we needed to identify a broader set of genes linked to the RAS pathway. We compared gene expression profiles of quiescent cell lines over- expressing RAS [6]. These data were generated using the Affymetrix GeneChip HG- U133PLUS2 and normalized using MAS5 [1] (GEO accession number, GSE3151)., We used the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test to compare the ten control cell lines with the ten cell lines over-expressing RAS and selected the most differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate FDR < 10% and fold change  4) between groups, this identified 332 RAS-associated genes including HRAS itself., The unique set of 339 RAS-associated genes and our knock- down genes are listed together with their corresponding statistics in Supplementary File 2., With the gene expression data from the eight knock-down experiments we used the validation framework illustrated in Figure 2(a)., Each knock-down was considered separately during the validation process. In a first step this entails the separation of the samples into those not related to the knock-down under consideration (the training samples ) and the samples related to it (the validation samples )., The validation samples are then analyzed to identify the list of RAS-associated genes significantly affected by the target knock-down., To compare the expression of genes in control versus knock-down experiments we used the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test with a FDR < 10%., The list of affected genes and their annotations are reported in Table 1 and Supplementary File 3 respectively., 2.2. Network inference methods Using the training samples (Figure 2(a)) we then proceed to the inference of a network using either GeneNet or predictionet with different weights on the priors (prior weight w  {0, 0.25,  0.5,  0.75,  0.95,  1}, see Supplementary Information Sections 1.1 and Section 1.2 for details of the inference algorithm and the parameter choices, respectively)., To define these priors we used the Predictive Networks (PN) web-application to identify gene-gene interactions reported in the biomedical literature and in structured biological databases [17] for this collection of genes., The PN database was generated in part, from PubMed abstracts and full-text papers using a text mining method in which each interaction is represented as a triplet [Subject , Predicate ,  Object ] such as [PGC,  is inhibited by,  SIRT1] or [CCNT1,  regulates,  PGC] ., While the Subjects and Objects represent genes the Predicates capture the interactions between these genes and include terms like regulates or is inhibited by that describe directional interactions, here Subject  Object or Subject  Object ,  respectively., PN contains 81022 interactions from PubMed documents and 1, 323, 776 interactions from the Human Functional Interaction [34] and the Pathways Common [7] databases (both retrieved on 2012-11-16).Olsen et al., Page 4 Genomics . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 May 01. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript Among the 339 RAS-associated genes, 325 are present in the PN database with a total of 37, 212 interactions of which 602 occurred between pairs of RAS-associated genes (Supplementary File 4)., Each interaction was characterized by an evidence score represented as the difference between the number of positive evidence citations and the number of negative evidence represented by a predicate such as does not regulate., More details on how the priors are used in predictionet are available in Section 1.1 in Supplementary Information., 2.3. Inferred networks Next we used the genomic data and priors to infer a gene interaction network for each knock-down (CDK5, HRAS,  MAP2K1,  MAP2K2,  MAPK1,  MAPK3, NGFR and RAF1) and each network inference methods ( GeneNet and predictionet with increasing prior weights)., As an example we will describe the network inferred for the HRAS knock-down using predictionet with prior weight w = 0.5 (Figure 3)., Due to the size of the network and the fact that we are primarily interested in the effect of the targeted perturbation (knock- down of HRAS), we focus on that part of the inferred network which models these effects, that are the children and grand-children (referred to as CH2) of HRAS., In theory the genes inferred to be descendants of the knockdown should correspond to the genes identified as significantly affected in the validation experiments., That is when considering our validation samples one can evaluate which genes exhibit a significant change in expression compared to the control samples, these affected genes should ideally be present in the knock-downs childhood (CH)., We then tested whether the inferred interactions (edges) in the network were present in the prior (the blue edges) or not (grey edges)., This together with the knowledge of which genes were truly affected by the knock-down allows us to identify possible new paths such as HRAS-POLA2-CCDC94 that although not previously reported in the literature, have empirical support in the perturbation data set., We find (Figure 3) that truly affected genes are present within the set of children as well as with the grandchildren of HRAS, these nodes are colored yellow., Although there are additional genes that are differentially expressed in response to HRAS knockdown for visualization purposes we focus on those that are predicted to be first or second-generation descendants of the knockdown target., To evaluate the networks overall quality we measured the ratio of those genes in the KDs childhood that are affected by the perturbation relative to those genes predicted to be in the childhood that are not affected., In the following section we will use this idea to design a systematic quantitative validation procedure by properly defining true positives, false positives and false negatives nodes., 2.4. Systematic validation Given an inferred network and a list of genes significantly affected by a specific knock- down, we can now classify the descendants of the knock-down in the inferred network depending on their response to the perturbation., If this is the case each of these descendants is classified as true positive (TP), as false positive (FP) if it was not affected by theOlsen et al., Page 5 Genomics . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 May 01. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript perturbation and finally if we know that a gene was affected by the knock-down experiment but it is not inferred as a descendant in the network, it is classified as false negative (FN),  as illustrated in Figure 4., This classification then allows us to compute for the inferred network, a quality measure such as the F-score (1) where F=1 corresponds to perfect classification of the affected genes and F=0 to no correctly identified affected genes., The question of which genes in the network qualify as descendant is difficult to answer and we chose to consider the knock-downs children and its grandchildren, that is the childhood of distance two (CH2)., In our experiments we see that considering only the direct children (CH1) will include too few genes and it is not possible to compute meaningful F- scores., On the other hand considering larger childhoods such as that of distance three (CH3) or even all descendants usually leads to too many genes predicted as affected., Therefore we focus on analyzing results obtained for CH2 while reporting those for CH1 and CH3 in Supplementary Information, Figure 4., Because increasing the size of the childhood almost automatically leads to higher F-score values due to the greater weight given to true positives versus false positives, one cannot solely rely on this quality measure., Therefore, a second measure is needed that will penalize networks with a greater number of edges. Our strategy is to generate a large number n of random networks and compare their F-scores to the F-score obtained with the inferred network to assess its significance using the following formula, (2) The larger the number of edges is, the easier it will be to beat the inferred networks performance with these random networks as the variation between networks is reducing with growing number of edges., We generated random networks by mimicking the inference using feature selection strategies as implemented by predictionet ., Keeping the number of edges and the maximum number of parents equal to those of the inferred network, the random network generator adds a uniformly distributed number of parents in [1, maxparents ] to each gene in the random network., This allows us to show that the feature selection and arc orientation strategy implemented in predictionet indeed performs statistically significantly better than a random edge addition procedure., Network performance is computed in terms of F-score values associated with a knock-downs childhood and any network with a p-value as defined in equation (2) lower than 0.05 is considered to be significantly better than random networks.Olsen et al., Page 6 Genomics .

Inferring networks with different prior weights for all knock-downs With this combination of two complementary quantitative validation measures we can now evaluate the inferred networks, those obtained using GeneNet with only genomic data and those obtained using predictionet with genomic data and priors for different weighing schemes., We allowed the prior weights w to vary between 0 and 1 the former corresponding to networks inferred from genomic data only and the latter to networks inferred from prior knowledge only, w  {0,  0.25,  0.5,  0.75,  0.95,  1}., To assure a fair comparison between GeneNet and the network inferred from data only with predictionet and the associated random network topologies, we constrained GeneNet networks to have the same number of edges as those networks inferred using predictionet ., We chose to take the number of edges obtained with predictionet using prior weight of 0.5 for two reasons., Firstly although GeneNet is not designed to natively integrate prior knowledge, we tested whether combining data and prior using predictionet will yield better results than a widely-used method that only use data., Secondly F-score values tend to be higher for networks with greater numbers of edges, therefore choosing a prior weight which results in an advantageous number of edges,  such as 0.5, seems reasonable., Using our validation framework (Figure 2(a)) we analyzed our set of colorectal cancer cell lines and computed F-scores of the inferred networks in cross-validation for each of the eight KDs (Figure 5A)., We first investigated the performance of networks inferred from prior knowledge only (prior weight w = 1)., To the best of our knowledge the informational value of priors retrieved from biomedical literature and structured biological databases has not yet been quantitatively assessed in the context of gene network inference., Indisputable these known interactions are often the result of biological experiments that are valid in the context in which they have been performed., However this does not necessarily mean that they carry information with respect to biological data sets generated outside of this context., In our study we found that networks inferred from priors only are informative as they yielded significant F-scores for all the knock-downs except NGFR (Figure 5A and Table 2)., This is due to the fact that we found only few prior information regarding the downstream effects of NGFR, with only one direct child and no grandchild in the priors, which is not sufficient to compute a meaningful F-score., To test whether combining prior knowledge with genomic data leads to an improved inference of gene interaction networks, we compared F-scores obtained for networks inferred from data only ( GeneNet and predictionet with prior weight w = 0), from priors only (prior weight w = 1) and a combination of data and priors (prior weight w  ]0, 1[)., As can be seen in Figure 5A networks inferred from combination of priors and genomic data yielded consistently higher F-scores than networks inferred from genomic data alone (Wilcoxon signed rank test p = 0.004 for prior weight w = 0.5)., When compared to networks inferred from priors only we observe statistically significant improvement in the F-score for five out of eight KDs (CDK5, MAP2K2,  MAPK1,  MAPK3 and NGFR,  Wilcoxon signed rank test p = 0.01 for prior weight w = 0.5)., Moreover the networks inferred from combined data sources are significantly better than random networks in most cases, except for NGFR for which the prior knowledge is limited (Figure 5A).Olsen et al., Page 7 Genomics . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 May 01. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript We then assessed the benefit of combining data sources by counting how many true positives can only be found by combining priors and genomic data, that is they are not present in the data only and/or priors only networks (Figure 4)., In other words it does not suffice to fuse the data and prior-only networks to get these true positives., Figure 5B represents the portion of true positives that can be found in the networks inferred from genomic data only, priors only or the combination of both., We observe in Figure 5B that there is little overlap between true positives identified in networks inferred from genomic data only or priors only, suggesting that priors and genomic data provide very different information regarding gene interactions., Moreover we find that a substantial proportion of new true positives could have only been found by combining data sources, highlighting the benefit of combining priors and data to infer networks (Figure 5B,  Table 2)., 2.4.2. Extrapolate to tumor patient data Having shown that the knock-down experiments enable quantitative assessment of the quality of an inferred network, we apply our validation framework to a large data set of 292 colorectal human tumors (expO data set2)., We infer gene interaction networks using the entire data set as training set and used the knock-down experiments to assess networks quality as before (Figure 2(b))., Such comparison between patient samples and laboratory models is recognized as imperfect as colorectal cell lines are not precise models for patients tumors [15, 23]., The networks inferred from colorectal tumor data were denser than those inferred from cell lines (Supplementary Information, Table 1), this is expected due to the larger sample size of the tumor data set (~300 vs ~100 for the colorectal tumor and cell lines, respectively) and its correspondingly greater diversity., Despite the difference in network density the F-scores were not statistically significantly different to those found for the cell line knock-down experiments (Wilcoxon signed rank test p  0.10, Figure 6)., We found that GeneNet performed better on the tumor data than on the KD data possibly due to the larger sample size., However GeneNet only provides significant results for MAPK1 compared to random networks (Figure 6). On the contrary networks inferred using combination of genomic data and priors with predictionet yielded significant F-scores in most cases, except for NGFR which is consistent with the cell line knock-down experiments., Again combining data with the prior knowledge improved F-scores for CDK5,  MAP2K1,  MAP2K2,  MAPK1, MAPK3 and RAF1., This is again consistent with the cell line results. Given that the networks inferred from colorectal cancer cell lines and tumor data (Supplementary Files 58) yielded similar F-scores, we compared their topologies to identify the edges inferred in both data sets and those specific to either cell lines or tumors., For this because we do not use the test data for validation, we infer a single network using the entire knock-down data set., This cell line network and the tumor network shared on average 22% of edges depending on the methods (4%, 5%,  20%,  31%,  33%,  33% for GeneNet ,  predictionet with prior weight w=0,  0.25,  0.5,  0.75, 0.95,  respectively,  Supplementary Information,  Table 2)., As expected the proportion of common edges increases with the prior weight, however the networks shared fewer than one third of their 2https, //expo.intgen.org/geo/Olsen et al., Page 8 Genomics . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 May 01. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript edges suggesting that either the gene interactions present in cell lines and tumors significantly differ from each other or that the sample size in the cell line knockdown experiments was not sufficient to infer networks that are generalizable to other data sets., Moreover we observed that most of the common interactions involve one of the eight KD genes (41% p<0.001) for predictionet with prior weight w=0.5), suggesting that more generalizable networks could be inferred when performing targeting experiments, which is supported by recent studies [3,  30]., We illustrated this result in Supplementary Information Figure 8 which represents the gene interaction network surrounding HRAS, which shows that most common interactions involve at least one of the KD gene., 3. Discussion Inference of biological networks from genomic and other data has the potential to provide insight into mechanisms driving complex phenotypes including diseases such as cancer., However, the validation of large gene interaction networks remains a challenging task. The most widely used validation approaches consist of comparing network edges to known gene-gene interactions derived from the literature or pathway databases., However, such validation is in many ways limiting and imperfect. Firstly it prevents the use of prior knowledge in network inference if this is to be used subsequently for validation as it would lead to over-fitting and thus provide an overoptimistic performance evaluation for the inferred networks., Secondly it may be that most prior knowledge are not specific to the biological conditions or phenotypes under investigation, which makes it difficult to identify a set of standard references of relevant interactions., Further we and others have suggested that prior knowledge could be used to improve network inference [9, 18],  therefore we developed a new network inference approach,  called predictionet , to efficiently integrate priors, in the form of gene-gene interactions extracted from biomedical literature and structured biological databases [17]., The field of network inference lacks quantitative unbiased validation frameworks purely driven by data [10,  21,  31]., In this paper we present a new validation framework using (I) experimental knock-down data to compute the inferred networks performance (F-score) and (II) to assess networks performance based on p-values computed using random networks as null hypothesis to ensure statistical significance of the results., These two parts are complementary as only relatively sparse networks are likely to be significantly better than random networks and networks with more interactions are more likely to yield higher F- scores., Within this framework we showed how difficult it is to infer networks solely based on genomic data both for GeneNet and predictionet ., Furthermore we provided evidence for the quality of prior knowledge retrieved through the Predictive Networks web-application., Finally we were able to show that combining genomic data and prior networks lets us achieve higher F-scores than either of the sources achieves by themselves, while at the same time inferring networks that were also significantly better than random networks., When using patients tumor data we obtained comparable results, suggesting that cell line experiments can be used for the validation of patient data.Olsen et al., Page 9 Genomics . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 May 01. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript This study has some potential limitations., First we targeted a small set of eight key genes from the RAS signaling pathway but assessed their effect on other genes from the entire genome., Second these KDs were performed for single genes, which do not allow us to assess the effect of multiple simultaneous KDs., Third we performed the KD experiments on two colorectal cancer cell lines extension of our validation framework to a larger number of cell lines and additional single and multiple gene KDs is likely to improve our ability to infer robust gene interaction networks., Lastly we focused on a RAS signature of 339 genes to limit the computational time required to infer multiple networks, we are working on parallelizing the predictionet package to enable network inference from more genes, potentially the whole genome., In conclusion we demonstrated that performance of gene interaction networks inferred from high-throughput genomic data can be quantitatively assessed and compared using targeted experiments., Moreover we showed that priors in the form of gene-gene interactions extracted from biomedical literature and structured biological databases using the Predictive Networks web-application, produce relevant networks on their own and substantially improve networks performances when efficiently integrated in the inference process., Finally we were able to use the gene perturbation data generated in cell lines to assess the performance of networks inferred from patient tumor samples, suggesting that our validation framework could be applied in a translational research setting., Supplementary Material Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.

Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the methodology:\n\n1. **Framework for Validation**: The authors propose a new validation framework that quantitatively assesses the performance of inferred gene interaction networks. This framework utilizes knock-down (KD) data from cell line experiments to evaluate the quality of the inferred networks.\n\n2. **Knock-Down Experiments**: The methodology includes conducting RNA interference (RNAi) mediated gene knock-down experiments targeting specific genes within a biological pathway of interest (the RAS signaling pathway in this case). The experiments are performed in two colorectal cancer cell lines (SW480 and SW620) with multiple biological replicates.\n\n3. **Gene Expression Profiling**: Following the knock-down experiments, gene expression data is collected using the Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U133PLUS2 platform. The data is normalized and processed to identify differentially expressed genes.\n\n4. **Iterative Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation**: The validation process employs an iterative leave-one-out cross-validation approach:\n   - A single gene knock-down is selected as the validation set.\n   - A predictive network model is built using the remaining knock-down experiments.\n   - The validation set is then used to assess the quality of the inferred network, focusing on connections local to the perturbation.\n   - This process is repeated for each knock-down to evaluate the network's predictive power.\n\n5. **Network Inference Methods**: The authors utilize two methods for network inference:\n   - **GeneNet**: This method computes full partial correlations and orders genes based on partial variances to identify directed acyclic causal networks.\n   - **predictionet**: This method integrates prior knowledge from biomedical literature and structured biological databases to infer an undirected network, which is then oriented using interaction information.\n\n6. **Use of Prior Knowledge**: The methodology emphasizes the integration of prior knowledge in the form of gene-gene interactions extracted from literature and databases. This prior information is used to adjust the rankings of interactions during the inference process.\n\n7. **Quantitative Assessment**: The performance of the inferred networks is quantitatively assessed using F-scores, which measure the accuracy of the predicted interactions against the true interactions identified in the knock-down experiments. The authors also compare the inferred networks to random networks to establish statistical significance.\n\n8. **Application to Tumor Data**: The validation framework is further applied to a larger dataset of colorectal cancer patient tumors to assess the generalizability of the inferred networks. The authors compare the networks inferred from cell line data with those from tumor data, analyzing the overlap and differences in network topology.\n\n9. **Statistical Analysis**: The methodology includes statistical tests (e.g., Wilcoxon signed rank test) to compare the performance of networks inferred from different data sources and to evaluate the significance of the results.\n\nOverall, the methodology combines experimental validation through targeted perturbations, advanced statistical techniques, and the integration of prior biological knowledge to improve the inference and validation of gene interaction networks."

This framework allows for a more rigorous evaluation of network inference methods.\n\n2. **Improved Network Inference**: The integration of prior knowledge derived from biomedical literature with genomic data significantly enhances the quality of inferred networks compared to methods that rely solely on genomic data. This was demonstrated through various experiments, particularly focusing on the RAS signaling pathway in colorectal cancer.\n\n3. **Quantitative Assessment of Networks**: The study introduces a systematic approach to validate inferred networks by using a leave-one-out cross-validation method. This involves assessing the predictive power of the inferred networks based on their ability to predict the effects of targeted gene knock-downs.\n\n4. **Performance Metrics**: The authors utilize F-scores as a measure of network quality, which allows for the classification of genes affected by knock-downs into true positives, false positives, and false negatives. This classification helps in quantifying the accuracy of the inferred networks.\n\n5. **Comparison with Random Networks**: The validation framework includes a statistical comparison of the inferred networks against random networks, ensuring that the performance of the inferred networks is statistically significant.\n\n6. **Application to Tumor Data**: The framework was also applied to a larger dataset of colorectal cancer tumors, showing that the networks inferred from tumor data yielded similar F-scores to those inferred from cell line experiments, suggesting that cell line experiments can be a valid model for assessing network quality in patient data.\n\n7. **Insights into Gene Interactions**: The study highlights that combining genomic data with prior knowledge leads to the identification of new true positives that would not be found using either data source alone, emphasizing the complementary nature of these approaches.\n\n8. **Limitations and Future Work**: The authors acknowledge limitations such as the focus on a small set of genes and the need for further validation across more diverse datasets and additional gene knock-down experiments.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper demonstrates that the integration of prior knowledge with genomic data can significantly improve the inference and validation of gene interaction networks, providing a robust framework for future research in this area."

      "question": "How was the data analyzed in the study?",
      "answer": "The data in the study was analyzed using a validation framework that combined knock-down experiments with network inference methods. The analysis involved the following key steps:\n\n1. **Knock-Down Experiments**: The researchers performed RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene knockdown experiments targeting specific genes in colorectal cancer cell lines. They measured gene expression data before and after the knockdowns to identify which genes were significantly affected.\n\n2. **Iterative Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation**: The analysis employed an iterative leave-one-out cross-validation approach. For each knock-down experiment:\n   - A single gene knock-down was selected as the validation set.\n   - A predictive network model was built using the remaining knock-down experiments.\n   - The validation set was then used to assess the quality of the inferred network, focusing on connections local to the perturbation.\n\n3. **Performance Scoring**: The performance of the inferred networks was quantitatively assessed by comparing the genes that were empirically determined to be affected (based on the validation data set) with those predicted to be affected by the models. This allowed the computation of performance scores, such as the F-score, which measures the accuracy of the network in predicting affected genes.\n\n4. **Network Inference Methods**: Two methods were specifically used for network inference: GeneNet and predictionet. The networks were inferred using genomic data and prior knowledge from biomedical literature. The integration of prior knowledge was shown to improve the quality of the inferred networks.\n\n5. **Statistical Validation**: The study also included a systematic validation procedure that classified genes as true positives, false positives, or false negatives based on their response to the knock-downs. This classification was used to compute quality measures for the inferred networks.\n\n6. **Comparison with Random Networks**: To ensure the statistical significance of the results, the performance of the inferred networks was compared to that of random networks. This involved generating random networks that mimicked the inference process and assessing their F-scores.\n\nOverall, the combination of experimental data from knock-downs and rigorous statistical validation provided a robust framework for analyzing and validating the inferred gene interaction networks."

This step is crucial for reducing technical variability and making the data suitable for comparison.\n\n2. **Selection of Unique Probesets**: The jetset package was used to select a unique probeset for each of the 19,218 unique gene symbols represented on the arrays. This ensures that each gene is represented by a single probeset, which simplifies downstream analysis.\n\n3. **Annotation of Genes**: Further annotations for the genes were obtained using biomaRt, which provides additional information about the genes that can be useful for interpretation.\n\n4. **Statistical Testing**: The Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was employed to compare gene expression profiles between control and knock-down experiments, identifying differentially expressed genes with a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of less than 10%.\n\nThese pre-processing steps were essential for ensuring the quality and reliability of the data used in the network inference and validation framework described in the study."

It highlights that while numerous methods have been developed for inferring biological networks, the validation of these models remains a significant challenge. The authors note that many existing validation approaches rely on comparisons with biological databases, which can be problematic as they assume static network topologies that do not account for changes across different phenotypes or in response to perturbations.\n\nThe review emphasizes that previous methods often fail to produce useful network models due to the lack of established gold standards for building and validating large gene networks. It points out that some methods have attempted to validate small network models through targeted biological experiments, but this approach is not feasible for large-scale networks. The authors also mention an alternative validation route based on simulated interventional data, which has its biases.\n\nThe authors propose a new validation framework that utilizes independent single-gene knock-down experiments to quantitatively assess the performance of inferred networks. This framework allows for a more unbiased evaluation of network inference methods by comparing the genes empirically determined to be affected by knock-down experiments with those predicted by the network models.\n\nIn summary, the literature review outlines the complexities of network inference, the limitations of existing validation methods, and introduces a novel framework that integrates experimental data to enhance the validation of inferred gene interaction networks."

They propose that extending the validation framework to include a larger number of cell lines and additional single and multiple gene knock-downs could enhance the robustness of inferred gene interaction networks.\n\n2. **Parallelization of the Predictionet Package**: The authors mention that they are working on parallelizing the predictionet package to enable network inference from a larger number of genes, potentially the entire genome. This would allow for more comprehensive analyses and the ability to infer larger networks.\n\n3. **Application in Translational Research**: The authors highlight the potential of their validation framework to be applied in a translational research setting, suggesting that further studies could explore its utility in clinical contexts, particularly in the validation of networks inferred from patient tumor samples.\n\n4. **Assessment of Multiple Simultaneous Knock-Downs**: They note that their current approach only assesses the effect of single gene knock-downs, and future research could investigate the effects of multiple simultaneous knock-downs to better understand gene interactions.\n\nThese directions aim to improve the understanding and inference of gene networks, particularly in the context of complex diseases like cancer."

In this method, one gene knock-down experiment is used as a validation set while the remaining experiments are used to build a predictive network model. This process is repeated for each knock-down experiment.\n\n2. **Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test**: This non-parametric test is used to compare gene expression data between control and knock-down experiments. It helps identify differentially expressed genes based on a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold.\n\n3. **F-score Calculation**: The F-score is computed to evaluate the quality of the inferred networks. It is a measure that combines precision and recall, providing a single score that reflects the accuracy of the network in predicting affected genes.\n\n4. **Random Network Generation**: To assess the significance of the inferred networks, random networks are generated to serve as a null hypothesis. The performance of the inferred networks is compared against these random networks, and p-values are calculated to determine statistical significance.\n\n5. **Feature Selection Techniques**: The paper mentions the use of Minimum Redundancy-Maximum Relevance (mRMR) for feature selection in the network inference process, which helps in identifying the most relevant genes for constructing the network.\n\nThese statistical techniques collectively contribute to the framework for quantitatively assessing the quality of inferred gene interaction networks based on experimental data."

The authors provide evidence that networks inferred from a combination of genomic data and prior knowledge yield higher F-scores than those inferred from genomic data alone, which may contradict earlier claims about the limitations of using prior knowledge in network inference.\n\n3. **Performance of Inference Methods**: The paper presents a new framework for validating gene interaction networks and shows that the performance of the GeneNet method, which does not integrate prior knowledge, is inferior to that of predictionet, which does. This finding may contradict previous studies that have claimed the efficacy of methods that do not utilize prior knowledge, suggesting that the integration of such knowledge is crucial for accurate network inference.\n\n4. **Generalizability of Cell Line Data**: The authors conclude that cell line experiments can be used to validate networks inferred from patient tumor data, which may contradict earlier research that has been skeptical about the generalizability of findings from cell lines to actual patient samples. The paper suggests that the inferred networks from cell lines and tumors yield comparable F-scores, indicating that cell line models can be reliable for network inference in a clinical context.\n\nIn summary, the paper presents findings that challenge the validity of traditional validation methods, the utility of prior knowledge in network inference, the performance of existing inference methods, and the generalizability of cell line data to patient tumors, which may contradict various aspects of previous research in the field."
