However, the lack of methods details and algorithm code undermines its scientific value. Here we identify obstacles hindering transparent and reproducible AI research as faced by McKinney et al., and provide solutions to these obstacles with implications for the broader field., The work by McKinney et al.1 demonstrates the potential of AI in medical imaging while highlighting the challenges of making such work reproducible., The authors assert that their system improves the speed and robustness of breast cancer screening generalizes to populations beyond those used for training, and outperforms radiologists in specific settings., Upon successful prospective clinical validation and approval by regulatory bodies this new system holds great potential for streamlining clinical workflows, reducing false positives,  and improving patient outcomes., However the absence of sufficiently documented methods and computer code underlying the study effectively undermines its scientific value., This shortcoming limits the evidence required for others to prospectively validate and clinically implement such technologies., By identifying obstacles hindering transparent and reproducible AI research as faced by McKinney et al., we provide potential solutions with implications for the broader field.Haibe-Kains et al., Page 2 Nature .

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Scientific progress depends upon the ability of independent researchers to (1) scrutinize the results of a research study, (2) reproduce the studys main results using its materials, and (3) build upon them in future studies2., Publication of insufficiently documented research does not meet the core requirements underlying scientific discovery3, 4., Merely textual descriptions of deep learning models can hide their high level of complexity. Nuances in the computer code may have dramatic effects on the training and evaluation of results5 potentially leading to unintended consequences6., Therefore transparency in the form of the actual computer code used to train a model and arrive at its final set of parameters is essential for research reproducibility., The authors state The code used for training the models has a large number of dependencies on internal tooling, infrastructure and hardware,  and its release is therefore not feasible ., Computational reproducibility is indispensable for high-quality AI applications78, more complex methods demand greater transparency9., In the absence of code, reproducibility falls back on replicating methods from textual description. Although the authors claim that all experiments and implementation details are described in sufficient detail in the Supplementary Methods section to support replication with non- proprietary libraries , key details about their analysis are lacking., Even with extensive description reproducing complex computational pipelines based purely on text is a subjective and challenging task10., In addition to the reproducibility challenges inherent to purely textual descriptions of methods the authors description of the model development as well as data processing and training pipelines lacks critical details., The definitions of multiple hyperparameters for the models architecture (composed of three networks referred to as the Breast, Lesion,  and Case models) are missing (Table 1)., In their original publication the authors did not disclose the settings for the augmentation pipeline, the transformations used are stochastic and can significantly affect model performance11., Details of the training pipeline were also missing. Without this key information, independent reproduction of the training pipeline is not possible. There exist numerous frameworks and platforms to make artificial intelligence research more transparent and reproducible (Table 2)., For the sharing of code, these include Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitLab among others. The multiple software dependencies of large- scale machine learning applications require appropriate control of the software environment, which can be achieved through package managers including Conda, as well as container and virtualization systems,  including Code Ocean,  Gigantum,  Colaboratory, and Docker., If virtualization of the McKinney et al. internal tooling proved to be difficult they could have released the computer code and documentation., The authors could have also created small artificial examples or used small public datasets12 to show how new data must be processed to train the model and generate predictions., Sharing the fitted model (architecture along with learned parameters) should be simple aside from privacy concerns that the model may reveal sensitive information about the set of patients used to train it., Nevertheless, techniques for achieving differential privacy exist to alleviate such concerns. Many platforms allow sharing of deep learning models including TensorFlow Hub,  ModelHub.ai, ModelDepot,  and Model Zoo with support for multiple frameworks such as PyTorch and Caffe, as well as the TensorFlow library used by the authors., In addition to improving accessibility and Haibe-Kains et al. Page 3 Nature . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 May 25. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript transparency such resources can significantly accelerate model development,  validation, and transition into production and clinical implementation., Another crucial aspect of ensuring reproducibility lies in access to the data the models were derived from., In their study, McKinney et al. used two large datasets under license, properly disclosing this limitation in their publication. Sharing of patient health information is highly regulated due to privacy concerns. Despite these challenges sharing of raw data has become more common in biomedical literature, increasing from under 1% in the early 2000s to 20% today13., However if the data cannot be shared, the model predictions and data labels themselves should be released, allowing further statistical analyses., Above all concerns about data privacy should not be used as a smokescreen to distract from the requirement to release code., Although sharing of code and data is widely seen as a crucial part of scientific research the adoption varies across fields., In fields such as genomics complex computational pipelines and sensitive datasets have been shared for decades14., Guidelines related to genomic data are clear, detailed, and most importantly, enforced. It is generally accepted that all code and data are released alongside a publication. In other fields of medicine and science as a whole this is much less common, and data and code are rarely made available., For scientific efforts where a clinical application is envisioned and human lives would be at stake we argue that the bar of transparency should be set even higher., If a dataset cannot be shared with the entire scientific community because of licensing or other insurmountable issues, at a minimum a mechanism should be set so that some highly-trained, independent investigators can access the data and verify the analyses., The lack of access to code and data in prominent scientific publications may lead to unwarranted and even potentially harmful clinical trials 15., These unfortunate lessons have not been lost on journal editors and their readers. Journals have an obligation to hold authors to the standards of reproducibility that benefit not only other researchers, but also the authors themselves., Making ones methods reproducible may surface biases or shortcomings to authors before publication6. Preventing external validation of a model will likely reduce its impact as it also prevents other researchers from using and building upon it in future studies., The failure of McKinney et al. to share key materials and information transforms their work from a scientific publication open to verification and adoption by the scientific community into a promotion of a closed technology., We have high hopes for the utility of AI methods in medicine. Ensuring that these methods meet their potential however, requires that these studies be scientifically reproducible., The recent advances in computational virtualization and AI frameworks are greatly facilitating the implementations of complex deep neural networks in a more structured, transparent,  and reproducible way., Adoption of these technologies will increase the impact of published deep learning algorithms and accelerate the translation of these methods into clinical settings., Supplementary Material Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.Haibe-Kains et al., Page 4 Nature .
