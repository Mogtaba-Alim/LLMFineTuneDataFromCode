There is a need to ac- count for artifacts during image data processing. Several studies have tried to address this data processing challenge by removing slices affected by DAs [4] or by using metal artifact reduction (MAR) algorithms [8]., Recently a convolutional neural network (CNN) [9] and hand-crafted radiomic feature-based model [10] have been developed to detect the presence of DAs in CT volumes., However to the best of our knowledge, no studies differentiated be- tween DAs of different magnitudes or quantified how the location of these artifacts could affect quantitative imaging features used to train radiomic models., Furthermore previous DA detection studies have classified hand-drawn regions of interest (ROI) as DA positive or DA negative [10] but have not examined the correlation between radiomic features in a given ROI and its distance from the DA source., These methods even if effective at screening datasets for artifacts, could cause vast amounts of data to be unnecessarily marked as unclean, even if the artifacts do not homogeneously affect radiomic features in the patient s image volume., Robustness and reproducibility of radiomic studies requires an un- derstanding of imaging artifacts and their influence on extracted fea- tures., This study explores the relationships between a tumour s radiomic features and its proximity to dental artifacts present in the images., Furthermore we introduce Artifact Labelling Tool for Artifact Reduction (ALTAR), a novel methodology to identify patient images that are at risk of impact from dental artifacts., This methodology will assist in safe- guarding radiomic studies and has been made openly available for usage by the radiomic community., 2.Materials and methods The design of our study is represented in Fig. 1. To train our new DA detection model we manually labelled a new CT dataset containing 3D axial scans of 3211 cancer patients for the presence of metal dental ar- tifacts., We then developed a novel sinogram-based detection algorithm to classify images with the strongest artifacts present, and we combined this with a pretrained binary DA detection CNN., We then evaluated the models and compared their classification performance to human annotators. Finally we performed a statistical analysis of radiomic features in order to determine the impact of DAs on features in the gross tumour volume (GTV) (Fig., 2). 2.1. Dataset retrieval and labelling The dataset used for this study consists of 3211 head and neck cancer axial CT image volumes collected from 2005-07-26 to 2017-08-17 at the University Health Network (UHN) in Toronto, Canada (REB approval #17-5871)., This dataset is referred to as RADCURE . We developed Artifact Labelling Tool for Artifact Reduction (ALTAR) an open-source algorithm and web-application enabling the review of large sets of im- ages and the annotation of the magnitude and location of the dental artifacts., Using this tool each 3D image in RADCURE was labelled by human annotators as either containing a strong,   weak, or no dental artifact., The location of the slice with the strongest artifact was also labelled or for images with no DA present, the location of the most central axial slice in the mouth was labelled., Full details of this labelling process are described in the Supplementary methods . 2.2. Radiomic feature analysis The relationship between quantitative imaging features and the ex- istence and location of dental artifacts was studied., 1547 radiomic features were extracted from each 3D image in RADCURE which con- tained a gross tumour volume (2490 images) using the default settings of the open-source Python package, Pyradiomics (version 2.1.2) [11, 12] ., A Wilcoxon rank-sum test between image features from volumes with strong DAs and image volumes with no DAs was performed, applying the Bonferroni correction to the p-values to adjust for multiple tests, and considering p D0.05 significant., Next the partial Spearman correlation (adjusted for tumour volume) between the feature values and DA-GTV distances was computed independently for each DA magnitude (1039 strong, 751 weak,  877 none)., Finally we removed 3D images where the GTV overlapped with the strongest DA slice and we performed the same Wilcoxon rank sum test between radiomic features from strong-DA and no-DA images from this smaller group of 1006 patients (529 strong, 477 no DA)., Fig. 1.The study design includes five main steps (1) retrieval of head and neck CT imaging volume dataset and labelling of DA, (2) initial classification of DA using a sinogram-based detection (SBD) method, (3) secondary classification of SBD-classified dental artifacts using a previously trained CNN, (4) model evaluation, and (5) exploration of the effect of DA magnitude and its distance from the GTV on radiomic features., C. Arrowsmith et al. Physics and Imaging in Radiation Oncology 18 (2021) 4147 432.3. Automated classification We created an automated three-class DA classification and location pipeline using a sequential combination of three algorithms., We devel - oped a thresholding and sinogram-based detection (SBD) algorithm to create the first classifier in the pipeline which predicts a binary DA class for each patient s 3D CT image volume., This was done by applying the Otsu threshold [13] to each axial slice and in order to segment the pa- tient s head., The head was then removed from the image and the remaining background pixels are transformed to the sinogram domain., We then apply a peak detection (Python Scipy version 1.4.1) algorithm on the mean sinogram intensities in the vertical stack of 2D images for a Fig., 2.An illustration of the two binary DA classifiers used in this study. (A) Two steps in the sinogram-based detection (SBD). First one slice from a CT volume is thresholded and blurred, before being thresholded again to remove pixels in the body of the patient., The remaining pixels are thresholded again, revealing the streaks outside the patient s body. The image is then transformed to the sinogram domain and the mean sinogram pixel intensity is computed., (B) An example of the mean sinogram intensity  for each slice in six CT volumes (each image represented with a different colour)., A peak detection algorithm is applied to this plot for a given patient to detect slices likely to contain DAs., We annotate the detected slices with Xs to show that the algorithm detected one peak from each of the green and blue curves (both images labelled as strong DA)., The dashed lines represent the peak detection threshold for each patient. (C) The CNN architecture used in the study. The network consisted of 5 convolutional layers (conv_1 to conv_5) creating a total of 64 filters. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend the reader is referred to the web version of this article.), Fig. 3.Flowchart of the SBD-CNN hybrid algorithm for dental artifact detection. Images were annotated manually and then first binned using SBD (Sinogram based detection) based on the average intensity of the corresponding sinogram., Subsequently, the original images were classified using the CNN model. Images that were labelled as artifact positive by both the SBD and CNN were categorized as having strong dental artifacts., Images labelled as artifact negative by both methods were labelled as having no artifacts. This way our hybrid model is capable of labelling images based on the strength of artifact presence. C. Arrowsmith et al. Physics and Imaging in Radiation Oncology 18 (2021) 4147 44patient. If a peak was detected, the entire 3D volume was classified DA positive . The original images were then passed to a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) for binary classification., This network was developed and trained by Welch et al. [9] and a detailed description of how it was implemented in our study is provided in the Supplementary methods ., We combined the binary predictions from the SBD algorithm and the CNN for each 3D patient scan to create a 3-class classifier using the decision tree architecture shown in Fig., 3. Finally we passed any images that were classified as strong  or weak  to the DA location detection algorithm., For this we developed a thresholding-based algorithm to detect the axial slice containing a DA in a given patient CT image volume., The thresholding-based algorithm works by first clipping the HU values between the maximum intensity in one patient s CT image volume and 200 HU above that maximum., The standard deviation of each axial slice is then computed and peak detection is performed on the standard deviations of each axial slice using the scipy find_peaks function in a similar manner to the SBD peak detection step., The specific parameters chosen for the peak detection function are described in detail in the Supplementary ., If any peaks are detected, the algorithm simply returns the indices of those peaks for that patient. Otherwise the lower bound of the clipping range is decreased by 50 HU and the process is repeated for the patient until at least one peak is found., 2.4. Performance assessment A subset containing 2319 patient image volumes was set aside for model evaluation., The remaining 892 images were used to develop the three-class hybrid algorithm and the DA location detection algorithm., The test set was chosen by removing any images that were used by Welch et al. in the training and evaluation of the CNN. Since this study used a cohort of patients from the same institution as RADCURE we ensured that no images used for model evaluation in our study were used by Welch et al., Furthermore since the thresholding location detection algorithm is intended to be used on DA-positive images, we tested this method on the 1551 patients who had a DA from the 2319 patient test set., We primarily used the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) to assess the accuracy of our prediction models., The MCC is equivalent to the Chi-square coefficient for binary labels and accounts for the poten - tial class imbalance., We found the MCC to be a useful metric for DA detection as an effective dataset cleaning tool should have a high ac- curacy and a low false-negative rate (the rate at which a classifier fails to detect DAs when they are present)., The MCC can also be generalized to multiclass cases allowing us to compare the performance of our binary and three-class classifiers., In the Supplementary we also provide the performance of the CNN on its own as a binary classifier using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC)., For all AUC and MCC values we also estimated a p-value from 5000 iterations of a randomized permutation test., 2.5. Research reproducibility The application we created to manually annotate images Artifact Labelling Tool for Artifact Reduction (ALTAR) can be downloaded from our GitHub repository (https, //github.com/bhklab/ALTAR )., The code for the SBD CNN, and thresholding location detection is open source (Creative Commons Non-Commercial) and freely available from on our GitHub repository (https, //github.com/bhklab/DA-Detection )., To ensure full reproducibility of our study we created a Code Ocean capsule to allow users to easily run and reuse our analysis pipeline (https, //co deocean.com/capsule/2097894/tree )., 3.Results 3.1. Dataset labelling After reviewing 3211 image sets using our ALTAR web-application we identified 2180 volumes containing artifacts (1289 strong and 891 weak) and 1031 volumes with no dental artifacts., The manual labelling was consistent in the set of 482 images that were labelled by two re- searchers, yielding three-class Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.73 (p DD0.01,  95% CI [0.66, 0.81]),  and 0.91 (p DD0.01,  95% CI [0.83,  0.96]) for binary classes (strong/weak vs none, Supplementary Table 2)., The annotators labelled the same slice as containing the strongest DA or the patient s mouth in DA negative cases,  in 46% of patients (Fig., 5A). The two annotators labelled the strongest DA slice to within 5 slices of each other 82% of the time. 3.2. Analysis of radiomic features and dental artifacts To test for differences between features from DA positive and DA negative image volumes, we performed a Wilcoxon rank sum test be- tween features from each group., We found that 442 features were significantly different between the DA and no DA groups (Wilcoxon rank sum test corrected p-value D0.05), while 55 features varied significantly between strong DA and no DA patients when the artifact was 40 mm80 mm from the GTV., No features were significantly different between strong DA and no DA for patients with a DA more than 80 mm from the GTV., To assess the correlation between the radiomic features and distance of the GTV from the DA slice we computed the partial Spearman cor- relation between DA-GTV distance and radiomic feature value, con- trolling for tumour volume (Fig., 4). 36 features were correlated with distance only in images with strong DAs (e.g. those same features were not correlated with distance when computed from weak and no-DA images). All but two of these 36 features were found to use the lbp- 3D-k  filter. Nine of these 36 features were also found to be significantly different between strong-DA and no-DA images in the Wilcoxon rank sum test., In order to validate the effect of removing bad images on radiomic features we removed all images where the centre slice of the DA over- lapped with any pixel in the GTV., We found that only 123 features were significantly different between the groups (p D0.05). Repeating the test with randomly selected samples of the same size this number of 123 features was in the bottom 4.1% of repeated test results., 3.3. Classifier performance The combined SBD and CNN DA three-class classifier yielded an MCC of 0.73 (p-value 0.0002, 95% CI [0.65,  0.81]) on 2319 images (945 strong,  606 weak,  and 768 without artifacts)., This was identical to the three-class agreement between human annotators (MCC 0.73 p DD 0.01, 95% CI [0.65,  0.81] Fig., 5B). This hybrid algorithm was able to make use of two different binary DA detection algorithms which inde- pendently performed worse than human labelling., Together the two methods complement each other and are able to stratify images into three distinct DA magnitude classes., The thresholding-based DA location detection algorithm was tested on 1551 images with artifacts (1231 strong, 856 weak)., The algorithm identified the exact slice which was labelled in 36% of cases. In 92% of cases, the algorithm identified a slice within 5 slices above or below the label (Fig. 5A). 4.Discussion The main goal of this study consists of investigating potential spurious correlations in radiomic features due to metal artifacts and creating an automated pipeline for DA classification in large imaging C. Arrowsmith et al., Physics and Imaging in Radiation Oncology 18 (2021) 4147 45datasets to safeguard against these risks and improve reproducibility., Using a subset of 2490 patients we extracted 1547 radiomic features and investigated statistical differences in these features based on their DA locations and magnitude., Then we used a large dataset of 3211 head and neck cancer CT image volumes to build a DA location and magni - tude classifier., Analysis of radiomic features between strong DA and no DA patients revealed that approximately a third of features varied significantly with dental artifact status when the DA was less than 40 mm from the GTV., We found that the number of features associated with dental artifact status decreased significantly as the distance between the GTV and DA increased., This suggests that the location plays an important role in the effect of DAs on radiomic features. To further investigate this distance dependence we examined the correlation between DA-GTV distance Fig., 4.Correlation between GTV-DA distance and feature values based on the partial correlation using Spearman correlation., (A) Venn diagram showing the number of features with |r| F0.55 calculated from patients from each DA class., This diagram only includes significant correlations (p D0.05). For instance 36 features had | r| F0.55 and were found in patients with strong DAs (pink region), but those features had |r| D0.55 when calculated from weak or no-DA images)., Nine features had |r| F0.55 when calculated for all three DA groups (grey region).

(A) Distributions of how close the predicted slice index is to the labelled index for the threshold-based and sinogram based- detection methods (e.g., ipredicted\u0000ilabelled). The difference in slice label between two human annotators for a set of 482 CT volumes is also shown., (B) Performance (MCC) of the DA magnitude classification techniques used in this study. The p-value of the MCC for all classifiers was D0.001). The sinogram-based detection (SBD) and convolutional neural network (CNN) are both binary classifiers., The SBD was tested on 3211 CT image volumes and the CNN binary classifier was tested on a subset of 2319 image volumes., The SBD-CNN hybrid algorithm is a three-class classifier and the three-class MCC is therefore displayed here., C. Arrowsmith et al. Physics and Imaging in Radiation Oncology 18 (2021) 4147 46and the radiomic feature values. We found that among the correlated features (Spearman correlation F0.55), only 0.5% of features (9 out of 1547 radiomic features) were found in DA negative volumes only., However, a larger set of 36 correlated features were specifically found in the strong DA volumes. Interestingly 34 features in this set are exclu - sively composed of radiomic features which used the Local - BinaryPattern3D-kurtosis  (lbp-3D-k ) filter, suggesting that their lack of robustness in the presence of DA makes them unsuitable for radiomics modeling., lbp-3D-k filter computes the kurtosis (a measure of the tailedness of a distribution) [14] from the local binary pattern, a rota- tionally invariant measure of texture in three dimensions [15]., We hy- pothesize that DAs are altering the width of the distribution of specific texture metrics in three dimensions., These strong correlations between DA-GTV distance and specific radiomic features highlights the need for robust data curation pipelines for DAs in radiomic studies., We were then able to further motivate the use of DA location detection in dataset cleaning. By removing images with their GTV in the same slice as the DA the number of features significantly different be- tween strong-DA and no-DA images was significantly reduced (123 DA- affected feature vs an average of 188 features by randomly selecting 1006 patients, p-value 0.041)., This highlights the need for a DA location detector in dataset cleaning. By removing only the images with a GTV overlapping with a DA we were able to significantly improve the robustness of the features extracted from the dataset., Interestingly the fact that only nine of those 36 distance-correlated features were significantly different between strong-DA and no-DA im- ages (based on the Wilcoxon rank sum test) suggests that these two analyses are detecting different types of dependency., In particular using the Spearman correlation with GTV-DA distance may be a more strict criterion by which to select features to exclude from a radiomics study., We suggest using both analyses in order to select features robust to DAs in future radiomics studies., To automate DA classification we propose a DA magnitude and location classifier to help reduce confounding correlations relating to DAs., Rather than using whole-CT volume DA classifiers to remove samples or patients from training sets we suggest using a DA location detection algorithm to only remove images where the DA is close to the CT region of interest., The binary DA CNN classifier from Welch et al. was found to perform just as well on this larger dataset (AUC 0.97 p DD 0.01,  95% CI [0.94, 0.99]) as it had in the original study (AUC 0.91  STD 0.01) and outperformed our sinogram-based detection method., However we were able to leverage the SBDs ability to discriminate between strong and weak artifacts (90% true positive rate (95% CI [for strong, 25% for weak DAs) to create a three-class DA classifier., The three-class classifier also performed as well as two human annotators with both the three-class MCC of the annotators and the algorithm being 0.73 (p DD0.01, 95% CI [0.65,  0.80])., In addition to developing a novel multi-class dental artifact detection method we developed an algorithm to detect the slice containing the artifact., We found that both the sinogram-based and the thresholding- based location detection methods agreed with a human-annotator as well as two humans would agree with one another., This was determined by comparing 482 images in our dataset that were annotated twice by different human observers (see Supplementary )., The algorithms pre- dicted the DA to be within 5 slices of the human label in 8090% of cases while two humans agreed on the label to within 5 slices in 82% of cases., Due to the simplicity of the thresholding-based algorithm it could be used as an efficient add-on to any DA detection algorithm, or used to annotate the locations of DAs in datasets where the DA status of images is known, but not their location., This could be useful for removing data corrupted by DAs from a dataset without having to exclude the entire CT volume of DA positive patients., In general our results show that it is crucial to quantify the image quality of datasets used in radiomic studies., We have shown that this can either be done using this DA detection tool to find images containing strong DAs, or manually labelling the data in order to understand the severity of DAs in the dataset., Although there are currently no widely-accepted tools for reducing the effects of DAs in radiomic studies, this work paves the way for future investigation of metal artifact reduction models, specifically targeted at improving reproducibility in radiomics., While multiple DA reduction approaches have been explored in clinical settings [1617] , these methods have not been investigated for their applications to reducing the impact of DAs on radiomic features (hand-engineered as with PyR- adiomics or otherwise)., This is an important area of research as our work highlights the strong links between DAs and radiomic features., Our study has several potential limitations. The analysis in this study has largely focused on the vertical location of DAs and their vertical distance from the GTV., This ignores any potential relationship between DA distance and radiomic features in the x y plane (within a slice)., We also acknowledge the inherent subjectivity of our manual labelling process as individual researchers and clinicians may have widely varying definitions of strong, weak and no artifacts., Although our analysis of annotator agreement shows that this was not a major prob- lem in our study it does mean that our work could be difficult to reproduce with different data and researchers., In conclusion we have developed a novel dental artifact detection algorithm which when combined with a convolutional neural network, created a three-class classifier for CT images with strong,  weak,  and no DAs., We then created a simple thresholding-based algorithm to detect the location of DAs in DA positive CT volumes., These new tools have been made open-source to be used in future studies to assess and account for the effects of DAs on radiomic models., We stress that our findings suggest that radiomic features are affected not only by the presence of DAs, but also by their location in the images., Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper., Acknowledgements This research was supported by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) radiomics grant (# 426366)., We would like to thank the head and neck group at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre for their contributions to this study and their invaluable work to create the dataset used in this study., We would also like to acknowledge the con- tributions of the Radiomics Medicine Program at the University of Toronto and the University Health Network., Finally we would like to thank Dean Zhu and Aleesha Masud for their help annotating the data and helping develop ALTAR., Appendix A.Supplementary data Supplementary data to this article can be found online at https://doi. org/10.1016/j.phro.2021.04.001 .

      "question": "Are there any contradictions between this paper's findings and previous research?",
      "answer": "Based on the content of the research paper, there are indications of potential contradictions between the findings of this study and previous research. \n\n1. **Sensitivity of Radiomic Features to Dental Artifacts**: The paper emphasizes that radiomic features are highly sensitive to dental artifacts (DAs) and that these artifacts can significantly alter the computed features in CT images. This aligns with previous studies that have acknowledged the impact of DAs on imaging quality and quantitative analysis. However, the paper suggests that prior research did not differentiate between DAs of varying magnitudes or quantify how the location of these artifacts affects radiomic features. This indicates a gap in previous research that the current study aims to address, suggesting that earlier findings may have overlooked the nuanced effects of DAs based on their proximity to the tumor.\n\n2. **Correlation Analysis**: The study found that 36 radiomic features were correlated with the distance from the tumor to the DA, particularly when the DA was strong. This finding suggests that the influence of DAs on radiomic features is not uniform and varies significantly with distance. Previous studies may not have explored this correlation in depth, which could lead to contradictions regarding the robustness of certain radiomic features in the presence of DAs.\n\n3. **Methodological Advances**: The paper introduces a novel automated detection method for DAs that combines conventional image processing with deep learning techniques. While previous studies have attempted to address the issue of DAs, the current study claims that no prior research has effectively quantified the impact of DAs on radiomic features in the manner presented. This could imply that earlier methodologies may have inadequately addressed the problem, leading to potentially conflicting conclusions about the reliability of radiomic analyses in the presence of DAs.\n\nIn summary, while the paper builds on existing knowledge regarding the impact of dental artifacts on radiomics, it also highlights shortcomings in previous research, particularly regarding the differentiation of artifact magnitudes and their specific effects on radiomic feature analysis. This suggests that there may be contradictions in the understanding of how DAs influence radiomic studies, which the current research aims to clarify."
