Whenever the recovery rate is gauged to be high enough subsequenthigh scoring but unknown inferred interactions are deemed good candidates for further experimental validation., Therefore such validation framework strongly depends on the quantity and quality of published interactions and presents serious pitfalls, (1) availability of these known interactions for the studied problem might be sparse, (2) quantitatively comparing different inference algorithms is not trivial, and (3) the use of these knowninteractions for validation prevents their integration in the inference procedure., The latter is particularly relevant as it has recently been showed that integration of priors during network inference significantly improves the quality of inferred networks., Toovercome these problems when validating inferred networks we recently proposed a data-driven validation framework based on single gene knock-down experiments., Using this framework we were able to demonstrate the benefits of integrating prior knowledgeand expression data., In this paper we used this framework to assess the quality of different sources of prior knowledge on their own and in combination with different genomic data sets in colorectal cancer., We observed that most prior sources lead tosignificant F-scores. Furthermore their integration with genomic data leads to a significant increase in F-scores, especially for priors extracted from full text PubMed articles, known co-expression modules and genetic interactions., Lastly we observed that the results areconsistent for three different data sets, experimental knock-down data and two human tumor data sets., Keywords: prior knowledge, validation, colon cancer, knockdown, network inference 1. INTRODUCTION Whilst it is now widely accepted that cellular processes are in general not only governed by single genes but instead alsoby networks of interacting genes ( Barabasi and Oltvai, 2004),  there is no gold-standard for validating these biological net-works ( Yngvadottir et al., 2009,  Fernald et al.,  2011)., However as network inference is increasingly used in biomedical researchsuch as drug discovery or disease classification ( Barabasi et al., 2011), also the subsequent validation needs to be revisited.The most commonly used approach consists in comparing theinferred network to known interactions stored in biologicaldatabases and research articles ( Altay et al., 2013)., However this approach has three major drawbacks,  Firstly,  these interactionsare rarely complete, secondly they might not be appropriate forthe studied problem and lastly, their quality has not yet beenevaluated., An alternative use for this prior knowledge is its integra- tion into the network inference algorithms in order to improvethe quality of inferred networks., Indeed we and others showedthat the combination of data and prior knowledge significantlyimproves the quality of networks compared to networks inferredfrom data only ( Djebbari and Quackenbush, 2008,  Mukherjee and Speed,  2008,  Olsen et al.,  2014 )., However if prior knowl- edge is used to improve the inference process its subsequent usein the quality assessment would dramatically increase the risk ofoverfitting., www.frontiersin.org June 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 177 |1 Olsen et al. Relevance of different prior sources Recently we proposed a purely data-driven approach relying on experimental perturbation data to identify the set of relevantgenes for a given problem ( Olsen et al., 2014 )., This validation framework not only provides the possibility to compare differentinference algorithms but furthermore allows us to independentlyassess different sources of prior knowledge by themselves and incombination with expression data., In this follow-up paper to Olsen et al. (2014 ) we use the proposed validation framework to evaluate the quality of a vari-ety of prior sources, both in combination with different pub-licly available tumor data sets and by themselves., We retrievedthe prior knowledge using the two web applications Predictive Networks (Haibe-Kains et al., 2012b )a n d GeneMANIA (Mostafavi et al.,  2008 ),  for a total of eight different sources., After the assess- ment of the different prior sources quality we infer networksusing three different microarray data sets, experimental knock-down data from cell line experiments and two publicly availablehuman tumor data sets., We quantitatively assess their qualitythrough the estimation of F-scores a well established quality metrics in network inference., We observe that most prior sources lead to significant F-scores. Their integration with genomic data leads to a significant increaseinF-scores especially for priors extracted from full text PubMed articles, known co-expression modules and genetic interactions.We also observe that the results are consistent for three differ-ent data sets, experimental knock-down data and two humantumor data sets., Furthermore we observe that combining dif-ferent sources can be beneficial compared to using a single priorsource., 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. METHODVALIDATION OF INFERRED NETWORKS The best case scenario in most real-world application is partialknowledge of the true, data-generating network., Therefore, theassessment of any inferred network cannot depend on this knowl-edge alone. As an alternative, we proposed a purely data-drivenvalidation framework proposed in Olsen et al. (2014 ). This val- idation framework depends on the availability of experimentalintervention data such as knock-down experiments., This type ofdata allows us for each knock-down experiment separately, tostatistically evaluate whether or not a gene in the data set wassignificantly affected by the experiment., In this case this rela-tion should be reflected in any inferred network in the sensethat the affected gene can be found downstream of the knockeddown gene., This in turn then allows us to quantitatively assessthe quality of inferred gene interaction networks by computingquality measures such as precision, recall or F-score ( Sokolova et al.,  2006 )., The outline of the framework is depicted in Figure 1 . Suppose that a number of single gene knock-down experimentswere carried out. Then one can use these experiments in a fivestep procedure: 1. Select a single knock-down and all corresponding replicates from the collection. 2. Use these samples to determine the set of genes that were sig- nificantly affected by the perturbation experiments by meansof statistical tests., FIGURE 1 | Quantitative validation framework for network inference. The framework relies on a set of single-gene knock-down experiments in a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme., 3. Use the remaining independent samples to infer a directed network. 4. Classify the knock-downs descendants (in the inferred net- work) into true positives false positives and false negativeswith respect to the affected genes identified in step 2., Thedescendants of a node in the network are defined to be the setof its children and grandchildren. 5. Repeat steps 14 until all perturbations have been used to assess the networks local predictive power., InOlsen et al. (2014 ) a network was inferred from the sam- ples not related to the single knock-down experiment (step3)., However in the same article it was shown that theseknock-down samples from cell line experiments can be usedfor validation not only in such a cross-validation schemebut also for networks inferred from independent tumor sam-ples, which demonstrates the generalizability of our validationapproach., The classification of the nodes in the network (step 4) follows the rationale that statistically significantly affected genes shouldbe found in a directed network downstream of the perturbedgene, its descendants ( Figure 1 )., Therefore all genes in the set Frontiers in Genetics | Bioinformatics and Computational Biology June 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 177 |2 Olsen et al., Relevance of different prior sources of descendants which are significantly affected by the perturba- tion can be classified as true positives (TP) and all significantlyaffected genes that are inferred outside of the set of descendantsas false negatives (FN)., Genes that are part of the descendantsin the inferred network but are not significantly affected by theperturbation are then false positives (FP)., This classification then allows us to compute the F-score the harmonic average of precision and recall F=2TP 2TP+FP+FN[0, 1], (1) where F=0 corresponds to no correctly identified affected genes and F=1 corresponds to perfect classification., To control for the density of the network and thus guarantee- ing that the F-scores are meaningful we generated 1000 random networks., Each random network is obtained from the inferrednetwork by shuffling the genes in this network. 2.2. MATERIALDATA Throughout this study, we use the perturbation data describedinOlsen et al. (2014 ) which are publicly available in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository ( B a r r e t te ta l ., , 2005 ), under accession number GSE53091. The samples of this data set consist of eight single gene knock-downs namely CDK5, HRAS,  MAP2K1, MAP2K2,  MAPK1,  MAPK3,  NGFR, and RAF1.These genes belong to the RAS signaling pathway which hasbeen showed to play a key role in colorectal cancer ( Zenonos and Kyprianou, 2013 )., The knockdown experiments were per- formed in two colon cancer cell lines SW480 and SW620 (NCBIGene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository ( Barrett et al., 2005 ) accession number GSE53091)., For each knock-down six biolog-ical replicates were obtained together with controls in both celllines, in total 125 samples., The data set furthermore consists ofthe 339 variables over expressing RAS as identified in Bild et al., (2005 )a n du s e di n Olsen et al. (2014 ). F o re a c ho ft h ek n o c k e dd o w ng e n e sw ei d e n t i f yt h e significantly affected genes by comparing the expression ofgenes in control versus those of the knock-down experi-ments with a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, using a false dis-covery rate (FDR,  Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 )<10% as a threshold for statistical significance., In Ta b l e 1 we present t h en u m b e ro fa f f e c t e dg e n e sf o re a c ho ft h ek n o c k - d o w nexperiments., We will use two publicly available tumor cancer data sets ( expO 2009,  Jorissen et al., 2010 ) to infer the networks., The first data set ( expO ) contains 292 human tumor samples and is T able 1 | Number of genes significantly affected by KD (out of 339 genes) based on gene expression data with FDR <10%., KD CDK5 HRAS MAP2K1 MAP2K2 Number of affected genes 73 122 33 38 MAPK1 MAPK3 NGFR RAF1 117 59 99 61accessible from GEO under accession number GSE2109., The sec- ond ( jorissen ) data contains 290 samples and is accessible from GEO under accession number GSE14333., 2.3. MATERIALSOURCES OF PRIOR KNOWLEDGE Possible sources of prior knowledge are manifold and includepublished articles, interactions stored in biological databases orsimilarity of gene expression values, also referred to as geneco-expression,  from published data sets., To efficiently accessthis information a number of different tools have been imple-mented including GeneMANIA (Mostafavi et al., 2008 )a n d Predictive Networks ( Haibe-Kains et al.,  2012a )., The former allows to upload a set of genes and returns a network of theknown interactions distinguishable by source ( Ta b l e 2 )w h e r e a s the latter uses text mining to retrieve known interactions fromPubMed abstracts and furthermore queries structured biolog-ical databases., Both tools allow to download the interactionsas flat text files which enables further use of these priors intoadvanced genomic analyses such as gene interaction networkinference., Here we will use the complete prior set retrieved by Predictive Networks (PN) and priors separated by source from GeneMANIA ., The different number of known interactions identified by eachtool and source are presented in Ta b l e 2 ., These can be roughly grouped into three categories (1) Co-expression and geneticwith >1000 interactions,  (2) PN and co-local, pathway and shared with 100 to 400 interactions, and (3) physical and predicted with <50 interactions., 3. RESULTS In this section we use the proposed validation framework (Figure 1 ) to independently assess the quality of the different pri- ors retrieved with Predictive Networks and GeneMANIA (Ta b l e 2 ) in isolation and in combination with three different genomicdata sets., We use the inference procedure introduced in Haibe-Kains et al. (2012a,b ) which is a two-step procedure implemented in the R/Bioconductor package predictionet . The first step is a fea- ture selection step based on the minimum redundancy maximumrelevance (mRMR, Ding and Peng,  2005,  Meyer et al., 2007 )c r i - terion whose robustness is improved by the integration of priorknowledge., The subsequent step is an arc orientation procedureusing a criterion based on interaction information ( McGill, 1954 ) in which prior integration is used to help orient the edges whichcould not be oriented from the genomic data., Given the centralrole of priors in predictionet we implemented a hyperparame-ter, referred to as prior weight ( w), enabling users to tune their confidence in the prior knowledge incorporated into the networkinference procedure., Prior weight wcan take value from 0 to 1; low wstands for low confidence in prior data. Note that w=0 forces predictionet to ignore priors (only genomic data are taken into account) while predictionet with w=1 will infer networks solely based on prior information, therefore ignoring genomicdata., We use each of the three different data sets (kd expO and jorissen ) to build networks integrating the different prior knowledge sources with different prior weights w www.frontiersin.org June 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 177 |3 Olsen et al., Relevance of different prior sources T able 2 | Specifications of prior knowledge retrieval tools GeneMANIA (GM) and Predictive Networks (PN)., T ool Source # interactions PN PubMed and databases (PN) 419 Co-expr (GM2) 2760 Co-local (GM3) 292 Genetic (GM4) 1546 GM Pathway (GM5) 100 Physical (GM6) 38 Predicted (GM7) 29 Shared (GM8) 199 {0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.95, 1}., The validation is then carried out for each of the eight knocked down genes. We thus obtain eight F- scores, one for the descendants of each KD. These F-scores are then further assessed by comparing them to F-scores of 1000 random networks. 3.1. PRIOR INFORMATION ONLY The first step in the assessment of the different prior sources qual-ity is the evaluation of the networks inferred using only thesesources (prior weight w=1)., In Figure 2 w ep r e s e n tt h er e s u l t s in terms of F-scores and significance compared to random net- works., When assessing this figure with respect to the number ofsignificant results obtained by each prior source, we can observethat PN performs best with seven out of eight significant results.The next best prior sources are GM6 and GM5 with six signifi-cant KDs., With the exception of GM3, all prior sources have atleast two significant results. Furthermore the F-scores obtained using prior source PN are amongst the highest values for all KDsexcept NGFR., On the contrary, GM6 obtains six significant KDsbut the F-scores are all below those obtained by PN. Assessing the prior sources performance with respect to the eight knock-downs it can be observed that some KDs are in gen-eral better predicted than others., Whilst most prior sources areable to obtain significant results for HRAS MAP2K1,  MAPK1,  and RAF1, significant results for half the prior sources for CDK5and MAPK3 they struggle to provide meaningful information forinference of gene interactions in the context of colorectal cancerwith the remaining two knock-downs (MAP2K2 and NGFR)., 3.2. COMBINATION OF DATA AND PRIOR INFORMATION In this section we assess the networks inferred from genomicdata (KD data in cross-validation, Figure 1 ) and prior knowledge with equal weight ( w=0.5)., In a first analysis we compare these F-scores to those obtained when inferring networks from data only ( w=0) and from prior knowledge only ( w=1)., A statis- tical test (Wilcoxon rank test) shows that the combination of dataand prior significantly improves the networks ( p-values <0.05) compared to data only (Supplementary Table 1) and prior only(Supplementary Table 1, with exception of GM2)., InFigure 3 , we present these F-scores for each knock-down and for each of the eight prior sources. For each knock-down theresults are ordered by F-score values, starting with the best result and color-coded by prior source., The best prior source for fourout of the eight knock-downs in PN: MAP2K2, MAPK1, MAPK3,and RAF1. The second highest number of best knock-downs isreached by GM2: CDK5, HRAS, and MAP2K1. The best priorsource for NGFR is GM4. On the contrary, the performance ofGM3, GM6, and GM7 prior sources is amongst the lowest. 3.3. MOST CONSISTENT PRIOR SOURCE ACROSS THREE DIFFERENT DATA SETS In this section we will show that the results presented in the previous section for the KD data also hold true when the net-works are inferred in combination with the two human tumordata sets., In Ta b l e 3 w ep r e s e n tt h ep r i o rs o u r c et h a ty i e l d e dt h e highest F-score for each of the eight knock-downs (prior weight w=0.5)., This table summarized the results in Supplementary Figures 9 and 10. The main observation is that the best prior source is consis- tent for all three data sets for four of the eight knock-downs, MAP2K1,  MAPK1,  MAPK3,  and NGFR., For the remaining four FIGURE 2 | Results when inferring networks with predictionet using only prior knowledge ( w=1).The height of each bar corresponds to the obtained F-score, colored by prior source., The x-axis specifies the prior source and includesif the F-score is significant with p-value <0.05 andforp-values <0.1 ., Frontiers in Genetics | Bioinformatics and Computational Biology June 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 177 |4 Olsen et al., Relevance of different prior sources FIGURE 3 | Results when inferring networks with predictionet using data and prior knowledge ( w=0.5).The height of each bar corresponds to the obtained F-score, colored by prior source., The x-axis specifies the prior source and includesif the F-score is significant with p-value <0.05 andforp-values <0.1 ., T able 3 | Best single prior source across three large colorectal cancer data sets (kd for knock-down experiments in colorectal cancer celllines, expO andjorissen for large human colon tumor data) when combined with microarray gene expression data (prior weightw=0.5)., KD KD data expO Jorissen CDK5 GM2 PN PN HRAS GM2 GM4 GM2 MAP2K1 GM2 GM2 GM2 MAP2K2 PN PN GM7 MAPK1 PN PN PN MAPK3 PN PN PN NGFR GM4 GM4 GM4 RAF1 PN GM8 PN knock-downs, the best prior source is consistent for two out of the three data sets,  PN for CDK5,  MAP2K2, and RAF1 and GM2for HRAS., 3.4. COMBINING DIFFERENT PRIOR SOURCES In this section we investigate whether the combination of priorsources (from a single prior source upto all eight sources) isbeneficial to the quality of the inferred networks., For each knock-down we infer a network using the best prior source,  then we addthe second best, etc., ( Figure 3 ). We test this procedure on the two independent human tumor data sets expO and jorissen t h ec o r - responding results are presented in Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 11, respectively., When combining expO data and with an increasing number of prior sources the results are better than those obtained using onlyone source for six out of the eight KDs., For the other two namelyMAP2K1 and NGFR, we have already observed in section 3.1that most prior sources are not informative., The number of priorsources that need to be combined to obtain the highest significantF-scores depends on the knock-down and range between three and eight., It is therefore not only important to determine whetherprior sources are relevant by themselves but also which combina- tion of sources will lead to the best results., Similar observationscan be made for the jorissen data set (Supplementary Figure 11). 4. DISCUSSION Using the quantitative validation framework we recently intro- duced in Olsen et al. (2014 ) we assessed the relevance of dif- ferent sources of prior information for the inference of largegene interaction networks from high-throughput gene expres-sion data sets., Our results suggest that most prior sources which include known interactions extracted from research arti-cles, genetic and physical interactions, co-expression and path-way databases yield significant networks in colorectal can-cer when used in isolation., Furthermore concurring withour previous results, we demonstrated that the vast majorityof prior sources significantly improves the inference of geneinteraction networks when combined with microarray geneexpression data., In our case study we showed that priors extracted from thePredictive Networks web application and the co-expressions reported in GeneMANIA are the most relevant prior sources in colorectal cancer as they yield the best networks in our valida-tion study., We also showed that these results are consistent acrossthree data sets composed of a set of knock-down experiments incolorectal cancer cell lines and large collections of human colontumor samples., As expected the quality of inferred gene interaction networks is not uniform over the network topology., For the eight geneswe knocked down to investigate their effects in colorectal cancercell lines we were able to infer statistically significant subnet-works for most,  but not all of them., For instance we observedthat the effects of NGFR, and MAP2K2 knock-downs are partic-ularly difficult to model., Interestingly genetic interactions andco-expression prior data enabled to build high quality networksfor NGFR, which suggests that priors extracted from diversesources are highly complementary., Our study supports the use of prior information into net- work inference and we are now working on improving methods www.frontiersin.org June 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 177 |5 Olsen et al., Relevance of different prior sources FIGURE 4 | Results when inferring networks with predictionet using expO data and prior knowledge ( w=0.5)., The height of each bar corresponds to the obtained F-score, colored by whichprior source was added.

      "question": "What validation methods were used to ensure the reliability of the results?",
      "answer": "The research paper employed several validation methods to ensure the reliability of the results in inferring gene interaction networks. The primary validation method used was a **data-driven validation framework** based on **single gene knock-down experiments**. This framework allowed the researchers to statistically evaluate the effects of gene perturbations and assess whether the inferred networks accurately reflected these effects.\n\nHere are the key validation steps outlined in the paper:\n\n1. **Experimental Knock-Downs**: The framework relied on conducting single gene knock-down experiments, where specific genes were targeted to observe the downstream effects on other genes.\n\n2. **Statistical Evaluation**: For each knock-down experiment, statistical tests were employed to determine which genes were significantly affected by the perturbation. This involved comparing gene expression levels in knock-down samples against control samples using methods like the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, with a threshold for statistical significance set at a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 10%.\n\n3. **Network Inference and Classification**: After identifying significantly affected genes, the remaining samples were used to infer a directed network. The descendants of the knocked-down genes in the inferred network were classified into true positives (TP), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN) based on whether they were significantly affected by the knock-down.\n\n4. **Quality Metrics**: The quality of the inferred networks was quantitatively assessed using established metrics such as precision, recall, and the F-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. This allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of the network's predictive power.\n\n5. **Comparison with Random Networks**: To control for network density and ensure meaningful F-scores, the results were compared against those obtained from 1000 random networks generated by shuffling the genes in the inferred network.\n\n6. **Cross-Validation**: The validation framework was applied in a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme, enhancing the robustness of the results by ensuring that the inferred networks were evaluated independently of the data used for their construction.\n\nOverall, the combination of experimental validation through knock-downs, statistical evaluation, and the use of established quality metrics provided a rigorous framework for assessing the reliability of the inferred gene interaction networks."
