Haibe-Kains et al., Nature 504 389393 (2013),  doi, 10.1038/nature12831 The comparative analysis by Haibe-Kains et al.1 concluded that data from two large-scale studies of cancer cell lines2, 3 showed highly discordant results for drug sensitivity measurements, whereas gene expression data were reasonably concordant., Here we cross- compared the two original datasets2, 3 against our own data of drug response profiles in overlapping cancer cell line panels., Our results indicate that it is possible to achieve concordance between different laboratories for drug response measurements by paying attention to the harmoni - zation of assays and experimental procedures., There is a Reply to this Comment by Safikhani, Z. et al. Nature 540, http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ nature20172 (2016). Haibe-Kains et al.1 reported on a comparative evaluation of two drug sensitivity and molecular profiling datasets, one from the Cancer Genome Project (CGP)2 and the other from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)3., In their analyses gene expression profiles between hundreds of common cancer cell lines across all genes showed high consistency between the two studies (median rank correlation (MRC) = 0.85), whereas the drug response data for 15 common compounds were highly discordant (MRC = 0.28 for half- maximum inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values)., This report1 and the accompanying commentary4 suggested that differences in laboratory protocols compounds and their tested concentration ranges, and computational methods may account for the differences, but these reports did not elaborate which of these factors are important and whether they can be controlled for., Here we reanalysed the doseresponse data from both CGP and CCLE using a standardized area under the curve (AUC) response metric, which we call the drug sensitivity score (DSS)5., We then compared the CGP and CCLE data with a new dataset of drug responses profiled using the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM) compound testing assay6, covering 308 drugs across 106 cancer cell lines., The FIMM data included 45 compounds in common with CGP and 14 with the CCLE in 50 cell lines (Supplementary Data 1)., In the AUC calculation we unified the drug concentration ranges across the CGP , CCLE and FIMM assays., We observed a significantly higher level of consistency ( P = 4.2  105) especially between the CCLE and FIMM drug response data (MRC = 0.74), as compared to the consistency between FIMM and CGP data (MRC = 0.54) ( Fig., 1a ). Similar experimental protocols were applied at FIMM and CCLE including the same readout (CellTiter-Glo,  Promega), similar controls (vehicle as negative control and positive controls of toxic compounds 100  M benzethonium chloride or 1  M MG132)., However, there were also differences, such as the plate format used (1,536 versus 384 wells). Importantly there was no effort made to standardize cell numbers used or any other parameters between the three laboratories, such as the source,  passage number and media used for cells, nor the origin and handling of drugs., Therefore this observed level of drug response agreement could be substantially improved by further standardization of the laboratory protocols., The CGP experimental protocol differed from the two others in terms of the readout (fluorescent nucleic acid stain Syto 60, Life Technologies), in the use of controls (drug-free cells as negative and no cells as positive controls), and the plate format used (96- or 384-well plates)., We compared the drug response profiles between the same cell lines from different laboratories in line with the approach of Haibe-Kains et al.1, in which they showed consistency in gene expression profiles from CGP and CCLE (MRC = 0.85)1., The Haibe-Kains et al.1 approach in which the correlation is calculated for each drug separately across the cell lines, showed more variability ( Fig., 1b ), owing to the fact that some drugs show minimal efficacy in all the tested cell lines. Analogously gene expression correlations vary more widely when analysed at the level of genes across cell lines (MRC = 0.58 between CGP and CCLE), as certain genes are not expressed above technical noise., Although both ways to compare the data are relevant to the overall goal of personalized Figure 1 | Consistency between drug response profiles across FIMM, CCLE and CGP ., a In the between cell line comparison, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient was calculated for the pairwise overlapping cell lines and over shared sets of compounds between FIMMCCLE (26 cell lines, 14 compounds),  FIMMCGP (41 cell lines,  45 compounds),  and CCLECGP (268 cell lines, 13 compounds)., The drug sensitivity score (DSS) profiles between FIMM and CCLE showed improved correlation compared with the correlation between FIMM versus CGP or between CGP versus CCLE ( P = 4.2  105 or P = 0.0045, respectively,  two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test)., b In the across cell line comparison1, the correlation was calculated for each drug across all of the cell lines., This led to decreased consistency yet still showed the same inter-laboratory differences after standardized data analysis ( P = 0.00034, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test, for comparisons both between FIMM versus CCLE and FIMM versus CGP or CGP versus CCLE correlations)., The coloured points indicate whether the comparison made use of the harmonized data analysis (see Methods), or the AUC values provided in the original studies1, 2., The box and horizontal bar represent the interquartile range and median of the correlation coefficients, respectively,  and the whiskers denote the most extreme data points., 0.20.20.61.0Rank corr elation Harmonized Unharmonized CCLE vs FIMM FIMM vs CGP CGP vs CCLEa 0.20.20.61.0 Harmonized Unharmonized CCLE vs FIMM FIMM vs CGP CGP vs CCLEbRank corr elation  2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature., All rights reserved. e6 | NATU re | VOL 540 | 1 december 2016therapy emphasized in the original publications2, 3, the same evaluation approach should ideally be used when comparing the consistency of gene expression and drug response measurements., In summary we show that standardization of assay methods and laboratory conditions will help to improve the inter-laboratory agreements in drug response profiling., Global standards similar to the minimum information about a microarray experiment (MIAME) standard for the microarray data7, should be developed., Methods We scaled the drug response readouts using the available positive and negative controls from CGP , CCLE and FIMM screens (FIMM doseresponse data points are provided in Supplementary Data 2)., Curve fitting for the scaled doseresponse curves was based on the original dose ranges using the four-parameter logistic model and the LevenbergMarquardt algorithm8, 9., We used the median of the triplicate measurements from CCLE (http //www.broadinstitute.org/ccle/home), and the single doseresponse measurements from CGP (provided by M. Garnett)., In the harmonized data analysis DSS was calculated based on the fitted dose response models (R-package available at https, //bitbucket.org/BhagwanY adav/ drug-sensitivity-score-dss-calculation)5., The DSS integration was restricted to the common concentration window shared between CGP CCLE and FIMM,  which was limited by the narrower dose range of the CGP data., The compounds were identified and matched using InChIKeys10. Cell line matching was based on the named mapping file provided by Haibe-Kains et al.1 followed by manual curation to guarantee that we compared exactly the same cell lines and chemical compounds., This work was financially supported by Academy of Finland (grants 269862 and 279163, T.A. ; 277293, K.W . ; Center of Excellence for Translational Cancer Biology, O.K. ), Cancer Society of Finland (K.W ., O.K., T.A. ), JSPS Bilateral programs (A.H.), Sigrid Juselius Foundation (A.H., K.W ., O.K. ), European Unions Seventh Framework Programme (FP7, grant 258068, EU-FP7-Systems Microscopy, O.K. ), and Doctoral Programme in Biomedicine (J.P .M. and B.Y . ).

Nature 540 http, //dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature20171 (2016) achieve greater consistency across pharmacogenomic studies., Here we provide specific responses to the main results reported by Mpindi et al.1 The FIMM and CCLE studies used a similar experimental protocol that included the CellTiter-Glo pharmacological assay, as opposed to the Syto60 assay used in CGP ., As pointed out by the authors1 there were also parts of the experimental protocols that were different between all the three studies, effectively preventing perfect replication of in vitro molecular and pharmacological profiles., In our initial analysis2 we showed that drug sensitivity measures for paclitaxel and lapatinib were more consistent between the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) dataset and CCLE, than between GSK and CGP or CCLE and CGP ., Given that both GSK and CCLE used the CellTiter-Glo assay we concluded that the use of different pharmacological readouts has a substantial effect on the consistency of drug sensitivity measurements., The results from Mpindi et al.1 further confirm this observation. However a recent study from Genentech suggested that laboratory-specific effects might induce even greater biases than the use of different readouts6., Indeed Haverty et al.6 showed that, although their CellTiter-Glo screen was more concordant The accompanying Comment1 by Mpindi et al., is an important contribution to the discussion of pharmacogenomic consistency for several reasons. Mpindi et al.1 were able to reproduce our initial finding2 of a substantial inconsistency between the pharmacological profiles generated within the Cancer Genome Project (CGP)3 and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)4, and explored potential reasons behind the problem and possible solutions., To do this they compared the CGP and CCLE to a new dataset generated by the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM) that includes 308 drugs that were tested across 106 cancer cell lines5., The authors shared the subset of the FIMM data overlapping with CGP and CCLE including 52 drugs tested in up to 50 cell lines (drug doseresponse curves and their comparison with CGP and CCLE curves are available in Supplementary Data)., Overall their comparative analysis1 of this newly released dataset supports our published finding2 of greater consistency between studies in which there is similarity in experimental methods., We agree with Mpindi et al.1 that harmonizing the readout drug concentration range, and statistical estimator makes it possible to  2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature., All rights reserved. Brief Communi Cations arising1 december 2016 | VOL 540 | NATU re | e7with CCLE their new drug sensitivity data generated using the Syto60 assay were more consistent to their previous screen than CGP , despite the use of the same pharmacological assay6., It therefore remains unclear whether there are other experimental factors that drive the observed inconsistencies between large-scale pharmacogenomic studies and further argues for a detailed analysis of experimental protocols., Similar to Pozdeyev et al.7 and the Comment by Bouhaddou et al.8 the authors investigated whether sensitivity metrics computed from the drug concentration range shared between studies yield higher consistency than the published metrics computed on the full (only partially overlapping) concentration range using different curve fitting algorithms., Concurring with previous results Mpindi et al.1 showed that the modified area under the curve (AUC) statistic (referred to as the drug sensitivity score (DSS)) computed on the shared concentra - tion range (harmonized) was better correlated between studies than published AUC values (unharmonized)., To test whether this marginal but significant improvement was due to the use of the same drug doseresponse curve modelling or the choice of concentration range, we reproduced the authors analysis using our PharmacoGx package9 and used the same curve-fitting algorithm for the FIMM CGP and CCLE studies., We observed significantly higher correlations across and between cell lines, for AUC values computed using a shared concentration range for the CGP and CCLE comparison ( P < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test,  Fig., 1 ). Although this observation held true for the correlations between cell lines for all comparisons restricting AUC computation to the common concentration range did not yield significantly higher correlation across cell lines for CCLE versus FIMM and CGP versus., FIMM ( Fig. 1 ). Our results confirm that restricting the analysis to the common concentration range improves consistency between CGP and CCLE, and to a lesser extent with the FIMM dataset., In our original report2 we computed correlation coefficients for each individual drug across cell lines, which was relevant to the overall goal of the CCLE and CGP studies to discover new genomic biomarkers of drug responses in order to increase the emergence of personalized treatment regimens., Mpindi et al.1 also computed the correlation of cell line sensitivity data across drugs (referred to as between cell lines in their presentation, see Supplementary Information)., While the application of the across cell line correlation analysis is more relevant for identifying biomarkers predictive of response to individual drugs, we agree with Mpindi et al.1 that correlations across and between cell lines should be compared in a consistent manner, as was done in our published in-depth reanalysis of CCLE and CGP10., Consistent with Mpindi et al.1 our results clearly demonstrate that the overall corre - lation across cell lines is lower than the correlation between cell lines (Supplementary Fig., 1). However gene expression data are significantly more concordant between studies than the drug response summary statistics (half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC 50) and AUC) values in all comparisons ( P < 0.002, Wilcoxon rank-sum test)., Consequently our observation that gene expression data are signifi - cantly more correlated than pharmacological response still holds., As we argued previously2 we agree with Mpindi et al.1 that there is a need for harmonization of experimental protocols and cross- validation of large pharmacogenomic studies, and that doing so will improve robustness and reproducibility of the associated data., Author A.

In the earlier study, Haibe-Kains et al. reported significant discordance in drug sensitivity measurements across two large-scale studies (CGP and CCLE), with a median rank correlation (MRC) of 0.28 for drug response data, suggesting a lack of consistency. In contrast, Mpindi et al. found that by standardizing the experimental protocols and harmonizing the assay methods, they could achieve a higher level of concordance in drug response measurements, particularly between the CCLE and their new dataset from FIMM (MRC = 0.74).\n\nThis suggests a contradiction between the findings of the two studies: while Haibe-Kains et al. highlighted the inherent inconsistencies in drug sensitivity measurements across different laboratories, Mpindi et al. demonstrated that such inconsistencies could be mitigated through careful standardization of experimental conditions. Furthermore, the paper emphasizes that the observed discrepancies in drug response data could be significantly improved by further standardization, which was not fully explored in the Haibe-Kains et al. study.\n\nAdditionally, while both studies agree that gene expression data show higher consistency than drug response data, Mpindi et al. provide evidence that with proper harmonization, the drug response data can also achieve a level of consistency that challenges the earlier conclusions of Haibe-Kains et al. Thus, the paper by Mpindi et al. not only contradicts the findings of Haibe-Kains et al. but also suggests a pathway to improve the reliability of drug response profiling in pharmacogenomic studies."
