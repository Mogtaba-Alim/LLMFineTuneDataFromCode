For this reason we provide in this paper a general discussion and perspective of gene regulatory networks., Specifically we discuss their meaning,  the consistency among different network inferencemethods, ensemble methods,  the assessment of GRNs, the estimated number of existing GRNs and their usage in different application domains., Furthermore we discuss open questions and necessary steps in order to utilize gene regulatory networks in a clinicalcontext and for personalized medicine., Keywords gene regulatory networks,  computational genomics,  statistical inference, network analysis,  biomarker,  personalized medicine,  systems biology 1., INTRODUCTION About 15 years ago inference of large-scale gene regulatory net- works (GRNs) was made possible thanks to the availability ofhigh-throughput gene expression data., Within this time manydifferent methods have been developed ( Liang et al.,  1998,  Butte et al., 2000,  Friedman,  2004,  Wille et al.,  2004,  Zhang et al., 2011) and used to enhance our understanding of diseases ( Basso et al.,  2005, Madhamshettiwar et al.,  2012 )., However despite their widespread usage in current biomedical research, there isstill much confusion about the basic meaning of GRNs,  ways ofassessment, and possible application areas., In this paper we aim to clarify some of these problems and also provide a discussion of important next steps in order to bringgene regulatory networks closer to the clinical and medical appli-cation., Furthermore we add some recommendations we considerimportant to make GRNs more popular among biologists andclinicians, as they require a dedicated platform for accessing andanalyzing inferred gene regulatory networks., 2. HOW DO WE CALL NETWORKS INFERRED FROM GENE EXPRESSION DATA For reasons of clarity we first define what we mean by a gene regulatory network., Definition 1. We call a network that has been inferred from gene expression data a gene regulatory network briefly denoted as GRN., From the above definition one can see that we are assuming a statistical perspective placing the data in the center of focus.Due to the nature of gene expression data, providing informa-tion about the abundance of mRNAs only rather than binding www.frontiersin.org August 2014 | Volume 2 | Article 38 |1 CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY Emmert-Streib et al., Gene regulatory networks information gene regulatory networks defined in the above sense provide information about regulatory interactions betweenregulators and their potential targets, gene-gene interactions, and potential protein-protein interactions (e.g., in a complex)(de Matos Simoes et al.,  2013a )., There are many examples where such networks have been studied ( Margolin et al. 2006, Werhli et al.,  2006,  Meyer et al.,  2008,  Stolovitzky et al.,  2009,  Emmert-Streib et al., 2012 ),  see Ta b l e 1 for a brief overview., So far there is no generally adopted parlance to name such inferred networks but the term gene reg- ulatory network (Hecker et al., 2009 )i sf r e q u e n t l yu s e da n dw i l l also be utilized in this paper., For completeness we would like to mention that there are a variety of conceptually different approaches to infer networksand we would like to refer the reader to the review articlesbyLee et al., (2009); Markowetz et al. (2007) for a thorough discussion. 3. IS THERE JUST ONE RIGHT METHOD? In the last years there have been many network inference meth-ods introduced and many comparisons have been conducted(Akutsu et al., 1999,  Margolin et al.,  2006,  Werhli et al.,  2006,  Meyer et al.,  2008,  Stolovitzky et al., 2009,  Emmert-Streib et al., 2012 )., As it seems the results of such technical comparisons depend crucially on the studied conditions, including,  type of thedata (simulated,  real),  size of the network,  number of samples, amount of noise,  experimental design (observational,  experimen-tal,  interventional), type of the underlying interaction structure(scale-free,  random,  small-world), error measure (global,  local), among others., For this reason it is unlikely that there is oneright method that fits all different biological technical andexperimental design conditions best., However if one asks less technical and more biological ques- tions about the meaning of the inferred networks, i.e., by eval- uating the biological consistency of inferred networks resulting from different network inference methods, there is supportingevidence that the differences might not be that large, as recently T able 1 | Brief overview of statistical network inference methods that have been introduced in recent years and the key methods (secondcolumn) on which the inference algorithms are based on to estimateinteractions., Name Method References RN Mutual information Butte and Kohane 2000 Aracne Mutual information, DPI Margolin et al.,  2006 CLR Mutual information with backgroundFaith et al., 2007 C3Net Maximal mutual information Altay and Emmert-Streib, 2010a BC3Net Bagging C3Net de Matos Simoes and Emmert-Streib, 2012 GENIE3 Regression Huynh-Thu et al.,  2010 GGM Full partial correlation Wille et al., 2004 MRNet Conditional mutual information Meyer et al., 2008 MI3 Three-way mutual information Luo et al.,  2008demonstrated for C3Net, BC3Net and Aracne ( de Matos Simoes et al.,  2013b )., Hence it is unlikely that there is just one method that outperforms all others for all conditions, but a number ofmethods result in an overlapping spectrum having the potentialto infer similar biological information., 4. ENSEMBLE METHODS A recent trend in the field of biological network inference is theuse of ensemble methods (Zhang and Singer, 2010 ) to improve their stability and accuracy., Ensemble methods have been popu-larized by Leo Breiman as exemplified by random forest classifiers(Breiman, 2001 ) that have at their heart bagging (Breiman,  1996 )., Briefly the underlying idea is to (1) bootstrap a given data set, (2) apply a network inference method, and (3) aggregate all sep-arate outcomes into a final result., Here it is possible to apply foreach bootstrap data set the same inference method or differentmethods, leading to the distinction between homogeneous andheterogeneous ensemble methods., Examples for network infer-ence methods that are based on this principle are ( Huynh-Thu et al. 2010,  de Matos Simoes and Emmert-Streib,  2012,  Marbachet al.,  2012 )., Although ensemble approaches to network inference are com- putationally intensive they have the clear advantage of beingstraightforwardly and efficiently implemented in large computercluster., Indeed if one runs an ensemble of size Bon a computer cluster with Bnodes, the computation time for the whole ensem- b l ei s( a b o u t )t h es a m ea sf o rj u s to n em e t h o dr u no no n ed e s k t o pcomputer., 5. ASSESSING INFERRED NETWORKS The assessment of inferred networks is an important and com-plicated topic., The reason for this is that networks are high-dimensional structured objects that enable modeling of diverseaspects of biological systems., There are two main issues one hasto face when assessing the quality of inferred biological networks (I) the definition of a set of true interactions, referred to asgold standard and (II) the choice of statistical measures to quan-titatively assess the quality of networks using this gold standard.The former issue is usually addressed by using known interac-tions from research articles ( Mostafavi et al., 2008,  Haibe-Kains et al., 2012 ) and structured biological databases such as KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000 ) or I2D ( Brown and Jurisica,  2005 )., The main disadvantage of this approach is that although the setof known interactions might be quite large, many of them mightnot be relevant to the biological conditions under investigation.For this reason, it is also important to note that the standardizedreporting of such contextual information is crucial for comparingcausal and correlative relationships between molecular entitiesmeaningfully., Examples for such are endeavors that provide com-puter processable languages are BEL PySB, and BCML ( Slater,  2014 )., As an alternative several research groups performed multiple perturbations of the biological system under study (cancer celllines for instance) to measure their effects and subsequentlyvalidate their inferred networks ( Frohlich et al., 2008,  Olsen et al.,  2014 )., This experimental design although significantly more lengthy and costly, enables to validate inferred interactions Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | Molecular Medicine August 2014 | Volume 2 | Article 38 |2 Emmert-Streib et al., Gene regulatory networks in conditions that are identical or closely mimic those used for network inference., As an example, Olsen et al. knockeddown 8 genes in the RAS signaling pathway in colorectal can-cer cell lines to quantitatively assess the quality of gene inter-action networks built from expression data of human colontumors., Given a set of known interactions one can use traditional sta- tistical error measures, such as F-score or AUC-ROC (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve)., These measures canbe used to assess the quality of networks at the global-level (forthe network as a whole) or at the edge-level (for each individualedge) or for many intermediate-levels (for instance for network-motifs), see Altay and Emmert-Streib (2010b),  Emmert-Streib and Altay (2010) ., That means already for generic statistical error measures there are many different levels that can be assessed.Furthermore, real biological data and simulated data can,  andshould,  be used for the assessment of networks., For real biolog-ical data this allows to assess the biological relevance of inferrednetworks e.g., by using GO or KEGG,  and simulated data enablea detailed analysis of any technical aspect., In general one shoulduse a large variety of quality and error measures on a routine way.Unfortunately, standards are currently not available,  but wouldneed to be developed.6., HOW MANY GENE REGULATORY NETWORKS EXIST? It is generally acknowledged that a phenotype is an emergentproperty of genotype-environme nt interactions., Specifically a phenotype results from molecular and cellular activity patternsfrom genotype-environment interactions., This implies that eachobservable phenotype is associated with phenotype-specific genenetworks because without changing molecular interactions aphenotype cannot change, this concept is illustrated in Figure 1 ., In this figure gene networks can be seen as a bottleneck betweenthe genotype and the phenotype with respect to their coupling.That means every change on the genotype level that will result ina change of the phenotype will also inevitably lead to a change inthe gene network structure as mediator between both levels., However since gene networks refer to all possible types of molecular networks, including the transcriptional regulatory net- work,  protein interaction network, metabolic network,  gene reg- ulatory network and interactions between these networks, it isl e s sc l e a rw h i c ho ft h e s en e t w o r k s , o ra l lo ft h e m , a r ea c t u a l l ychanged., Moreover because a gene regulatory network can poten-tially represent many types of physical biochemical interactionsamong genes and gene products ( de Matos Simoes et al., 2013a ) it can be expected that gene regulatory networks are highly phe-notype specific ( Schadt, 2009,  Emmert-Streib and Glazko,  2011 )., FIGURE 1 | Schematic overview of the general role gene networks play in understanding phenotypes. www.frontiersin.org August 2014 | Volume 2 | Article 38 |3 Emmert-Streib et al. Gene regulatory networks Establishing such relationships will therefore be a complex task but also provides an opportunity to catalog phenotypes quantita-tively., An example for the analysis of tissue-specific networks canbe found in Guan et al. (2012) where 107 tissue specific network have been studied. Currently the number of GRNs is difficult toestimate but based on these preliminary results one can hypoth-esize that there are more than 200 different GRNs for Humanalone, because this corresponds about to the number of differ-ent cell types., However also pathological cells manifesting tumorshave their own characteristic networks ( Emmert-Streib et al., 2014 ) implying that there are probably thousands of different gene networks in Human., 7. USAGE OF GENE REGULATORY NETWORKS It is important to emphasize that the inference of gene regulatorynetworks is not the final result, but these networks are supposedto help in solving a number of different biological and biomedicalproblems., 7.1. CAUSAL MAP OF MOLECULAR INTERACTIONS Maybe the most frequently named use of gene regulatory net-works is to serve as a map or a blueprint of molecularinteractions., In this respect such a network can be used to derivenovel biological hypothesis about molecular interactions, e.g.,  forthe transcription regulation of genes, which can then be investi-gated in wet lab experiments by using,  e.g., ChIP-chip and geneexpression experiments ( Bussemaker et al.,  2001,  Basso et al.,  2005 )., In such a case GRNs represent causal biochemical inter- actions because the predicted links are supposed to correspond toactual physical binding events between molecules., It is importantto note that the inference of such causal interactions between geneproducts is a challenging task, because it goes beyond the mereassociation between such entities that would include also indi-rect relations/interactions involving intermediate gene productsas well., However despite the limitations of association networksit is interesting to note that also such networks capture valuablebiological information ( Butte et al., 2000 )., An important aspect of this application is that the GRNs represent statistically significant predictions of molecular inter-actions obtained from large-scale data., Given the very large num-ber of potential interactions between 20 000 genes in Human and6000 gene in yeast, the GRNs are of tremendous help in nar- rowing these numbers down to potential interactions for whichstatistical support is available., Overall, this enables more effectiveexperiments by an adopted experimental design. 7.2. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND PERTURBATION EXPERIMENTS An under appreciated applicability of gene regulatory networksis to use these for guiding the experimental design of newexperiments., Specifically many high-throughput experimentsare screening experiments generating observational data., Thatmeans these experiments are not controlled by establishing con-ditions that enhance molecular target processes to improve thesignal strength of these, but they merely observe the state of thesystems as it is,  without interventions or perturbations., A down-side of such screening experiments is that the signal about e.g., certain pathways, may be too low to be inferable by statisticalmeans., However using prior knowledge about partial gene reg- ulatory networks inferred from such observational data may allowto overcome these obstacles systematically and help in designingperturbation or intervention experiments to stimulate the molec-ular system purposefully., That means by identifying the parts ofthe molecular system that are not well detected based on inferrednetworks, dedicated perturbations can be constructed to boosttheir active responses., 7.3. NETWORKS AS BIOMARKERS In recent studies it has been argued that (sub-)networks couldalso be used as biomarkers,  e.g.,  for diagnostic, predictive orprognostic purposes ( Chuang et al.,  2007,  Ben-Hamo and Efroni,  2011,  Chen et al., 2011,  Dehmer et al.,  2013a )., This is particularly plausible for a complex disorder like cancer because the hall-marks of cancer are represented by pathways rather than individ-ual genes ( Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011 ) and the crucial aspect of pathways is that their constituting genes are actively interactingwith each other., For this reason network-based biomarkers canbe seen as statistical measures that consider the interaction struc-ture between individual genes explicitly., In contrast, biomarkersbased on individual genes neglect these completely. For furtherapplications of network-based biomarkers see also Dehmer et al. (2013b) . In the near future we expect to see similar applications also for other types of complex disorders, because,  despite their differ-ences among each other, all of them share a need for consideringinteraction changes., Unfortunately developing network-basedbiomarkers is considerably more complex than using univariateand multivariate gene signatures., Also quantitatively, it remainsto date unclear which gain one should expect from this new typeof biomarkers, if any Staiger et al., (2012) . 7.4. COMPARATIVE NETWORK ANALYSIS When more and more gene regulatory networks from different physiological and disease conditions become available, it will bepossible to statistically compare these networks ( Dehmer and Emmert-Streib,  2007, Dehmer and Mehler,  2007 )., This will allow to learn about interaction changes across different physiologicalor disease conditions and enrich our biological and biomedi-cal understanding of such phenotypes ( Ideker and Krogan, 2012,  Islam et al.,  2013 )., Besides using classical comparative measures such as the graph edit distance or the Zelinka distance, topo- logical indices could be also employed for such an analysis,  seeDehmer et al., (2013c) . It might be challenging to determine which similarity or distance measures are suitable to performsuch a comparative network analysis and different types of net-works as well as different biological questions may require dif-ferent approaches, see ( Sharan and Ideker,  2006,  Przulj,  2007,  Mithani et al.,  2011,  Pache and Aloy, 2012 ) for protein interaction networks or metabolic networks,  for instance., However in order for this approach to succeed it will be necessary to establish databases, similar to sequence or proteinstructure databases, that provide free access to the inferred generegulatory networks from different physiological and disease con-ditions., To this end it may be necessary to form an internationalcoalition because the expected effort to establish such a database Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | Molecular Medicine August 2014 | Volume 2 | Article 38 |4 Emmert-Streib et al., Gene regulatory networks and interactive access interfaces is anticipated to be larger than of sequence databases., 7.5. NETWORK MEDICINE AND DRUG DESIGN For establishing a network medicine useful for clinicians it willbe necessary to integrate different types of gene networks witheach other ( Shapira et al., 2009,  Barabasi et al.,  2011 ), because each network type carries information about particular molecu-lar aspects., For example whereas the transcriptional regulatorynetwork contains only information about the controlling regula-tions of gene expression, protein interaction networks representinformation about protein-protein complexes., Taken together an integration of various important molecular interaction typesresults in a comprehensive overview of regulatory programsand organizational architectures., Also information about tem-poral changes in the network structure are important to under-stand immune response, infection and differentiation processes(Rozenblatt-Rosen et al.,  2012,  Yosef et al.,  2013 )., Also for a more efficient design of rational drugs the utiliza- tion of gene networks are indispensable ( Ghosh and Basu, 2012,  Fortney et al.,  2013 )., For this reason both subjects would profit tremendously if there would be more large-scale gene expressiondata available together with, e.g.,  survival data and drug-doseresponse information., This would allow to create e.g.,  a connec-tivity map ( Lamb et al., 2006 ) that is based on the similarity of molecular interaction networks rather than on the mere simi-larity of expression profiles., Overall this would help us on ourway to a more personalized medicine ( Chan and Ginsburg,  2011 ), because condition specific gene regulatory networks are closer to the phenotype than genetic or epigenetic markers, see Figure 1 for a visualization., 8. KNOWLEDGE PLATFORM FOR MEDICAL AND CLINICAL PRACTICE It is important to emphasize that gene regulatory networks are not the final outcome of a biological or biomedical study, butan intermediate result., For this reason interrogation platformsare needed that allow the downstream analysis of such networks.Specifically, aside from databases that store inferred GRNs, net-work analysis tools and visualization layouts are needed that allowan easy integration with biological and clinical information, e.g., in form of GO and KEGG databases or clinical patient and gen-eral epidemiological data., Such a knowledge platform shouldhold cross-disease information similar to the OMIM (OnlineMendelian Inheritance in Man)., Furthermore it would be desirable if such a knowledge plat- form has an intuitive to use interface allowing also non-technicalexperts the exploration of GRNs., For a practical realization, e.g.,the tranSMART platform ( Athey et al., 2013 ) could be utilized. TranSMART is based on the open source i2b2 (informatics forintegrating biology and the bedside) framework, sponsored bythe NIH Roadmap NCBC, to provide clinicians with the toolsto integrate clinical genomics with medical patient record data.An attractive feature of tranSMART is that it can be combinedwith Galaxy, an open,  web-based user interface, which allows theconnection to a variety of programming languages., That meansa researcher without specific bioinformatic expertise can utilizeR scripts e.g., provided by Bioconductor,  CRAN or individu- ally developed packages, via a web-based graphical user inter-face for analyzing GRNs., Importantly, Galaxy offers also severalmechanisms to ensure the reproducibility of research results. 9. CONCLUSION In this paper we discussed important aspects of gene regulatorynetworks inferred from gene expression data., Due to the mul-tifaceted nature of GRNs for which we gave some examples inthis paper, a discussion about these networks cannot be one-dimensional because this would give a misleading impression oftheir meaning and potential usage., For this reason we tried toprovide a broad discussion touching upon a variety of differ-ent aspects to emphasize the intriguing depth offered by generegulatory networks., We think that neither the future of biology nor medicine is conceivable without gene networks in general, whereas gene regu-latory networks form an important subtype of these, because suchnetworks can be seen as a practical embodiment of systems biol-ogy., However in order to exploit and utilize such networks effi-ciently in molecular biology, cellular biology and the biomedicalsciences we need to establish comprehensive databases., FUNDING Matthias Dehmer thanks the Austrian Science Funds for support-ing this work (project P26142)., Matthias Dehmer also gratefullyacknowledges funding from the Standortagentur Tirol (formerlyTiroler Zukunftsstiftung)., ACKNOWLEDGMENT We would like to thank Ricardo de Matos Simoes and ShaileshTripathi for fruitful discussions., REFERENCES Akutsu, T., Miyano, S., and Kuhara, S.
