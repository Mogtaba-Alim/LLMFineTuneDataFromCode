Importantly PharmacoGx implements the PharmacoSet (PSet) class, allowing us to cre- ate shareable R objects integrating all aspects of pharmacogenomic datasets, from cell line and drug annotations to the molecular and pharmacological data 12., Each CWL pipeline is allocated a specific subroutine that is required for PSet creation which includes curating cell and drug annotations,  computing drug response, and incorporat-ing processed molecular profiles for a given dataset (Table 2) 11, 12., To accomplish this in a semi-automatic fashion we incorporated each pipeline into a CWL workflow, where PharmacoGx computes each stage of a pipeline and GRAY 2013 GRAY 2017 UHN Breast 2017 UHN Breast 2019 Cell lines 91 91 83 85 Drugs 89 107 4 8 Experiments 9413 9756 52 689 Molecular data and

a PSet., This workflow not only transparently indicates the pipelines that are being executed but also ensures that each pipeline is executed in the same manner if replicated, enforcing reproducibility 11., In addition the support of interoperability through CWL can be highlighted, as each pipeline stage that generates a corresponding output interacts with subsequent stages, which can be further enforced through specifying file-specific ontologies., These pipeline interactions validate the integrity of each given output object and PSet generated to ensure that it can be used for secondary analyses 11, 12., Interoperability through shared ontologies is also supported by PharmacoGx as our pipelines curate and assign unique identifiers to each cell line and drug compound in each dataset, where the identifiers are used in subsequent pipeline stages to verify that the data is correctly compiled 12., Therefore the unique identifiers not only validate PSets that are generated, but also maximize consistency across existing PSets., However because every dataset requires a different way of transforming and processing the data, due to variability in the way the data were initially shared and structured for each study, GRAY and UHNBreast possess their own CWL pipelines and workflow to accommodate for the differences 1417, 19., Because CWL is a standardized language each pipeline must include input and output defini- tions, base commands,  and requirements (e.g.,  resource,  Docker)11., In addition each CWL pipeline and workflow must be accompanied by a YAML (YAML Aint Markup Language) or JSON file, which consists of an object array that defines a class and path for each input in the respective pipelines., In order for our CWL pipelines to execute successfully they must specify the following, hints (docker requirement to run PharmacoGx ), inputs that declare a type and input binding position (Rscripts,  annotation files,  raw drug data, processed molecular data),  outputs that declare a type and output binding (e.g, processed drug sensitivity R objects,  PSets),  and a base command (to Fig., 2 Breast cancer PharmacoSet (PSet)

//doi.org/10.1038/s41597-019-0174-7 www.nature.com/scientificdata www.nature.com/scientificdata/run Rscript), in the specified CWL file11, 12., Therefore in order for our CWL workflows to be fully documentented and reproducible, each pipeline must be defined as an input and possess a successful runtime independently11., Having to explicitly specify these parameters required to run each pipeline along with the inputs and outputs in CWL provides an added layer of transparency to the pipelines, as well as allowing users to have control over data provenance., One of the highlights of our CWL workflows is the computation of drug response data for both datasets, which include AAC (Area Above the drug-dose response Curve), IC 50 (maximal drug concentration to achieve 50% cell growth inhibition), Hill-Slope (measurement of slope of a drug-dose response curve), Einf (max- imum theoretical inhibition), and EC50 (drug concentration for which 50% of maximum response is observed) (see Methods)., Computed AAC was later utilized in a post-PSet analysis to determine the concordance between a gene-drug association in both datasets through calculating the concordance index (CI) between respective RNA-seq and the AAC data (see Methods) 1417, 19., For GRAY  we computed AAC,  IC50,  Hill slope values,  and included published GI50,  GR50,  GEC50, GRmax,  GRinf,  hGR,  and GRAOC,  data14, 17 (see Methods)., For UHNBreast recomputation of AAC,  IC50,  and Hill slope was also performed,  along with Einf, and EC5015., Tracking Data Provenance and Validating Pipeline Integrity Tracking data provenance with CWL can be further enhanced through the use of the provenance flag (prov - enance) when executing the PSet workflows11., Here a Research Object is automatically generated, which is a directory that acts as a bundled container for all of the resources utilized and produced within our workflows, including metadata that annotates each resource 11, 22., Within this object is a data directory that contains each input file used in the workflow with a unique and fixed checksum11., We are given granular transparency across the entire workflow at every stage as we are able to map each checksum to a respective input file and location in the data directory, including all of the Rscripts that were utilized within a pipeline, through a workflow metadata file that is generated., In addition to a checksum each PSet is also assigned a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID), which provides an additional layer of provenance to accurately identify the PSet that was generated by the work- flow 11, 12., Moreover this is accompanied by a provenance metadata file, which provides users with the ability to use checksums and UUIDs to accurately identify when each file was called and generated along the entire execution of a workflow11., Therefore a Research Object confirms the reproducibility of our CWL workflows and validates the PSet that was generated with a respective runtime by providing rich metadata that tracks data provenance at each stage of a workflow., Harnessing Docker to Create a reproducible runtime PharmacoGx integrates seamlessly with CWL as we leverage CWL s Docker capabilities to containerize the pack- age and run all of our pipelines in an isolated environment11, 12, 21., Docker is a tool that allows for PharmacoGx to be uniformly deployed with all software dependencies in a containerized runtime environment where all of our computations are performed and PSets are produced 12, 21., The Docker container is invoked upon CWL workflow execution where all the input files for a given pipeline become mounted into the container and all output files produced in the isolated environment are recovered into a local environment 11, 23, 24., Another advantage of Docker is the ability of containers to utilize and share the hardware resources of the environment it is being run in25., Therefore PharmacoGx deployment is not only consistent, but also portable across both cloud and high perfor - mance computing environments, as our Docker image is also publicly available through Docker Hub (https, //hub.docker.com/r/bhklab/pharmacogxcwl) 24, 25., The ability to standardize the manner in which PSets are produced through CWL and develop an additional layer of abstraction for pipeline execution through Docker, allowed us to create and deploy reproducible and transparent pharmacogenomic pipelines that can be shared with the research community and replicated., Sharing of Data and Pipelines In order for a study to be computationally reproducible data and pipelines must be well documented,  uniquely identified, and easily accessible in a persistent location to other researchers 26., To accomplish this we utilized the Harvard Dataverse to share our PSets for both breast cancer pharmacogenomic datasets, along with Code Ocean to share our CWL pharmacogenomic pipelines 13, 18., Harvard Dataverse is an online data repository for transparently preserving and sharing research data with other researchers18., By creating a container known as a dataverse within the platform researchers are able to deposit their datasets and corresponding metadata, in an organized fashion and make them easily discoverable for others to download and share., Each dataset can be also assigned a unique DOI which allows a dataset to possess a persistent location, as well as allow researchers to accurately identify and share a specific dataset of interest., In addition subsequent updates (versions) to a dataset can be uploaded, with accompanying metadata that explains the update and its changes, providing a layer of data provenance to the research community., We also transferred our reproducibility measures to the pipeline level as we deposited and shared our CWL workflows through Code Ocean, a reproducibility platform that allows for researchers to upload,  share, and run published and configured code 13., Data is uploaded into a capsule which provides a computational environment for others to run code in the capsule, without the need to manually execute it locally with the addition of installing any dependencies 13, 27., Moreover code can also be assigned a persistent DOI, providing the ability to accurately share and retrieve pipelines, as well as verify the reproducibility of published results directly through the compute capsule., Because Code Ocean does not currently support running multi-container pipelines and therefore our CWL workflows,  we used the platform to host our workflows and raw data, provide execution instructions,  and run a post-PSet analysis for biomarker discovery., Our PSets can be found on Harvard Dataverse at the following https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/BXIY5W 28. Our CWL workflows can be found on Code Ocean at the following https //doi.org/10.24433/CO.7378111.v3 29., 5 Scientific Data | (2019) 6166 | https, //doi.org/10.1038/s41597-019-0174-7 www.nature.com/scientificdata www.nature.com/scientificdata/Utilization of PSets for Biomarker Discovery In order to demonstrate the utilization of our PSets for cancer research, we identified ERBB2 expression as a biomarker for lapatinib in both the GRAY 2017 and UHNBreast 2019 datasets (Fig., 3) (see Methods). To investi- gate this pharmacogenetic association6 we utilized processed RNA-seq expression and computed drug response (AAC) from each PSet1417, 19., We subsequently identified 39 cell lines from the GRAY PSet and 50 cell lines from the UHNBreast PSet that include both gene expression data for ERBB2 and drug response data for lapatinib and computed the strength of significance of this gene-drug association using the concordance index (CI)., CI estimates the probability that random pairs of samples will be similarly ranked by two variables in order to iden-tify the agreement (concordance) between the two variables 3032., We found that ERBB2 expression was strongly predictive in both the GRAY and UHNBreast datasets (CI = 0.73, p-value = 4.8E-15 in GRAY and CI = 0.63,  p-value = 0.015 in UHNBreast)., This argues against the null hypothesis that ERBB2 expression is independent of lapatinib response. This analysis can be reproduced through our Code Ocean capsule29. Discussion The utilization of CWL allows us to create and execute transparent and reproducible pharmacogenomic pipelines that can be validated and easily shared with the scientific community 11., The standardized architecture of the language allows users to create language-agnostic pipelines and workflows that enforce strict parameter specifi-cations to ensure execution is consistent., In addition users are able to incorporate Docker into their runtimes,  where data ingestion, analysis, and exportation all occur in an isolated container environment that promote repeatable execution 11, 23, 24., Users are also able to track data provenance across the entire execution time by cre- ating Research Objects in CWL, which validates each portion of data flow from input to output,  through check-sums and UUIDs 11, 22., Lastly CWL pipelines and workflows are scalable and portable across many computing environments, such as the cloud, which gives users the ability to easily share their analyses and harness a plethora of various hardware resources to successfully execute their workloads that would not be possible with using on premise resources 11, 24, 25., A common practice in pharmacogenomics is sharing study data as supplementary files through a journal, or through online sharing platforms/repositories such as Synapse and GitHub, which was the case for both the GRAY and UHNBreast datasets 1417, 19., However the challenge becomes assembling these data into a form that can be successfully analyzed and interpreted when shared., We were able to accomplish this in a reproducible manner by utilizing study data from a variety of sources and assembling it into a meaningful and useful form for cancer researchers, which are PSets,  through CWL and PharmacoGx 11, 12., Therefore our pipelines form the bridge between raw pharmacogenomic data and assembly in a transparent fashion., With our pipelines utilizing the versatile PharmacoSet class many data types from other datasets can be easily encapsulated for PSet generation, such as methylation,  chromatin accessibility (e.g.,  ATAC-seq),  metabolomics, protein expression 33,  and radiation therapy response34, given that it follows the PharmacoSet data structure12., This provides many opportunities for researchers to process and analyze a plethora of data for their studies., However our workflows do have limitations, including the inability to identify changes to pipelines,  input data,  and PSets, at the file level,  when updates are pushed, and the files are taken into an environment outside of Harvard Dataverse and Code Ocean., However with storing our data on Harvard Dataverse and pipelines on Code Ocean with rich metadata, users will be able to retrieve any updated files on both repositories and accurately identify the exact changes to each file., In addition CWL Research Objects provide checksums and UUIDs only after a runtime is complete, which are bound to the file name and not persistently attached to a file for use in subsequent workflow runs 11., Thus if an input file is updated and re-utilized in a workflow, we must manually keep track of all checksums and UUIDs that were assigned to it by CWL over time., In the future we hope to increase transparency and repro-ducibility by automating these pharmacogenomic pipelines in a manner that keeps track of all input and output data at the file level through the use of automatically generated unique identifiers that are persistent., Moreover we hope to provide users with an interface that provides options for processing drug sensitivity and molecular profiles in a generated PSet., Methods Computation of drug response data. Our CWL pipelines process raw pharmacological data of the GRAY and UHNBreast datasets14,15,17. This encompasses the computation of AAC, IC50, Hill-Slope, Einf, and EC50. With regard to the sensitivity metrics drug potency and efficacy is a measure of AAC, potency is a measure of IC50 and EC50,  while Einf is a measure of efficacy35, 36., Our pipelines address the issues of metric summarization incon- sistency and processing reproducibility across studies through the utilization of PharmacoGx , which efficiency standardizes the computation of drug sensitivity parameters for any pharmacogenomic dataset12, 30.PSet GRAY UHNBreast Meta ana lysisN 39 50 89Cinde x 7.35e0 1 6.30e0 1 6.92e01Pva lue 4.77e151.53e02 2.03e0 4 0.40 .5 0.60 .7 0.8 Concor dance Inde x Fig., 3 ERBB2 expression as a biomarker for lapatinib in GRAY 2017 and UHN Breast 2019.

The GRAY dataset includes published processed drug response data14,17. The published data was curated, annotated, and compiled into a PSet using PharmacoGx12. These metrics include growth inhibition (GI) and growth rate inhibition (GR) GI50,  GR50,  GEC50, GRmax,  GRinf,  hGR,  and GRAOC., The sensitivity metrics can be defined as1417,  GI50, the drug concentration for 50% inhibition of cell proliferation., GR50: the drug concentration (c) to achieve GR(c = GR50) = 0.5. GEC50: the drug concentration for which 50% of maximal effect is observed. GRmax: the GR observed at the highest drug concentration. GRinf: the effect of the utilization of an infinite drug concentration. hGR: the fitted curve Hill coefficient. GRAOC: the effect of a drug across AOC estimated concentrations. CWL pipeline execution steps. Each CWL pipeline within a workflow executes a custom R script with computational processing procedures for generating each PSet, which follow the same structure,  regardless of the dataset being analyzed 11, 12., Each PSet that is generated begins with the execution of an R script that gathers curated identifiers for each cell line, tissue,  and drug compound within each dataset., The curated identifiers are then used to collect cell line and drug metadata and generate a data array of the corresponding cell line and drug response experiment., The raw drug response data is then processed using PharmacoGx 12 while the published drug response data is annotated and compiled., The pre-processed molecular profiles from each dataset are later organized into an ExpressionSet which are data structures with processed data in the form of matrices with associated feature, phenotypic,  and annotation data 37., The last pipeline in our workflow compiles the curated unique identifiers cell line and drug metadata,  computed drug response data,  published drug response data, and molecular profile ExpressionSets into a PSet through the PharmacoSet class in PharmacoGx 12., To execute a CWL workflow cwltool must be run on the CWL and YAML files that are defined for a dataset workflow, where the -provenance flag generates a Research Object11, cwltool -provenance /outputdir getUHN2017_Workflow.cwl getUHN2017_ Workflow.yml Biomarker discovery., We utilized the GRAY 2017 and UHNBreast 2019 PSets to identify an associa- tion between ERBB2 expression and lapatinib drug response across cell lines1417, 19., We identified 39 and 50 cell lines from the GRAY and UHNBreast PSets respectively, that possessed both ERBB2 gene expression and drug response data (AAC) for lapatinib., With AAC being one of the most commonly used drug sensitivity metrics we utilized the gene expression and computed AAC data within the GRAY and UHNBreast PSets to assess this gene-drug association (expression-based biomarker) through calculating the concordance index and p-value 15, 30, 31., Our code for this analysis utilizes the summarizeSensitivityProfiles and summarizeMolecularProfiles functions in PharmacoGx to extract lapatinib response and ERBB2 expression data from the GRAY 2017 and UHNBreast 2019 PSets12., This response and expression data was subsequently used to compute the concordance index and p-value between them, for both PSets,  using the concordance index function within the survcomp R package38., Data availability The GRAY and UHNBreast PSets generated through our CWL workflows can be found on Harvard Dataverse at https, //doi.org/10.7910/DVN/BXIY5W 28, while the raw pharmacological and molecular data used in this manuscript for each respective study can be found on our Code Ocean capsule at https, //doi.org/10.24433/CO.7378111.v3 29., The GRAY RNA-seq CNV , and 2017 drug response data used in this manuscript is available on Synapse (https, //www.synapse.org/#!Synapse, syn2346643/wiki/62255)., The GRAY processed methylation data is located on the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE42944) while the mRNA (U133A and Exon 1.0 ST array) data is available from ArrayExpress (E-TABM-157 and E-MTAB-181)., The UHNBreast RNA-seq data can be found on the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE73526) while the remaining molecular profile data can be found at http, //neellab.github.io/bfg/., The UHNBreast 2017 drug response data is available from PharmacoGx while the 2019 data is available on our Code Ocean capsule., Code availability Our CWL workflows a tutorial describing the installation and execution procedures for our workflows, and the code for our biomarker discovery analysis can be found on our Code Ocean capsule (https, //doi.org/10.24433/CO.7378111.v3) 29. references 1., D Argenio, V .
