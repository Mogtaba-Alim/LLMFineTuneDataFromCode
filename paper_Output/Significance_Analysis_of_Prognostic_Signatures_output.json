The score derived from SAPS summarizes three distinct significance tests related to a candidate gene sets association with patient prognosis., The statistical significance of the SAPS scoreis estimated using an empirical permutation-based procedure to estimate the proportion of random gene sets achieving at least as significant a SAPS score as the candidate prognostic gene set., We apply SAPS to a large breast cancer meta- dataset and identify prognostic genes sets in breast cancer overall, as well as within breast cancer molecular subtypes., Only a small subset of gene sets that achieve statistical significance using standard statistical measures achieves significance using SAPS., Further the gene sets identified by SAPS provide new insight into the mechanisms driving breast cancer development and progres- sion., To assess the generalizability of SAPS we apply it to a large ovarian cancer meta-dataset and identify significant prognostic gene sets., Lastly we compare prognostic gene sets in breast and PLOS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 1 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1002875 ovarian cancer molecular subtypes, identifying a core set of shared biological signatures driving prognosis in ER +breast cancer molecular subtypes, a distinct core set of signatures associated with prognosis in ER 2breast cancer and ovarian cancer molecular subtypes, and a set of signatures associated with improved prognosis across breast and ovarian cancer., Results Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures (SAPS) The assumption behind SAPS is that to use a prognostic association to indicate the biological significance of a gene set, a gene set should achieve three distinct and complimentaryobjectives., First, the gene set should cluster patients into groups that show survival differences. Second the gene set should perform significantly better than random gene sets at this task, and third, the gene set should be enriched for genes that show strong univariate associations with prognosis., To achieve this end SAPS computes three p-values ( P pure,  Prandom, and Penrichment ) for a candidate prognostic gene set., These individual P-Values are summarized in the SAPS score. The statistical significance of the SAPS scoreis estimated by permutation testing involving permuting the gene labels ( Figure 1 )., To compute the Ppure we stratify patients into two groups by performing k-means clustering (k = 2) of an n6pdata matrix, consisting of the npatients in the dataset and the pgenes in the candidate prognostic gene set., We then compute a log-rank P- Value to indicate the probability that the two groups of patients show no survival difference ( Figure 1A )., Next we assess the probability that a random gene set would perform as well as the candidate gene set in clustering cases into prognostically variable groups., This P-Value is the Prandom.T o compute the Prandom we randomly sample genes to create random gene sets of similar size to the candidate gene set., We randomly sample rgene sets and for each random gene set we determine a Ppure using the procedure described above., The Prandom is theproportion of Ppure at least as significant as the true observed Ppure for the candidate gene set ( Figure 1B )., P r/C22PPPure Prognosis rPPure Prognosis/C2/C3 1 r Third we compute the Penrichment to indicate if a candidate gene set is enriched for prognostic genes., While the procedure to computethe P pureuses the label determined by k-means clustering with a candidate gene set as a binary feature to correlate with survival, the procedure to compute the P enrichment uses the univariate prognostic association of genes within a candidate gene to producea gene set enrichment score to indicate the degree to which a geneset is enriched for genes that show strong univariate associationswith survival ( Figure 1C )., To compute the P enrichment we first rank all the genes in our meta-dataset according to their concordanceindex by using the function concordance.index in the survcomp package in R [16]., The concordance index of a gene representsthe probability that for a pair of patients randomly selected in ourdataset, the patient whose tumor expresses that gene at a higherlevel will experience the appearance of distant metastasis or deathbefore the other patient., Based on this genome-wide ranking weperform a pre-ranked GSEA [17 18] to identify the candidate genesets that are significantly enriched in genes with either significantlylow or high concordance indices., The GSEA procedure for SAPShas two basic steps. First an enrichment score is computed toindicate the overrepresentation of a candidate gene set at the topor bottom extremes of the ranked list of concordance indices., Thisenrichment score is normalized to account for a candidate genesets size. Second the statistical significance of the normalizedenrichment score is estimated by permuting the genes to generate the P enrichment (see Refs., [1718] for further description of pre-ranked GSEA procedure), which indicates the probability that a similarlysized random gene set would achieve at least as extreme anormalized enrichment score as the candidate gene set(Figure 1C )., The SAPS scorefor each candidate gene set is then computed as the negative log 10of the maximum of the ( Ppure, Prandom, and Penrichment ) times the direction of the association (positive or negative) (Figure 1D )., For a given candidate gene set the SAPS scorespecifies the direction of the prognostic association as well as indicates theraw P-Value achieved on all 3 of the ( P pure prognosis , Prandom prognosis ,  and Penrichment )., Since we take the negative log 10of the maximum of the (Ppure prognosis Prandom prognosis , and Penrichment ), the larger the absolute value of the SAPS score the more significant the prognostic association of all 3 P-Values ., The statistical significance of the SAPS scoreis determined by permuting genes generating a null distribution for the SAPS scoreand computing the proportion of similarly sized gene sets from the null distribution achieving atleast as large an absolute value of the SAPS scoreas that observed with the candidate gene set., When multiple candidate gene sets areevaluated after generating each gene sets raw SAPS P-Value by permutation testing, we account for multiple hypotheses andcontrol the false discovery rate using the method of Benjamini andHochberg [19] to generate the SAPS q-value (Figure 1E )., In our experiments we have required a minimum absolute value(SAPS score) of greater than 1.3 and a maximum SAPS q-value of less than 0.05 to consider a gene set prognostically significant., Thesethresholds ensure that a significant prognostic gene set will haveachieved a raw P-Value of less than or equal to 0.05 for each of P pure, Prandom,  and Penrichment , and will have achieved an overall SAPS q-Value of less than or equal to 0.05.Author Summary A major goal in biomedical research is to identify sets of genes (or biological signatures) associated with patient survival, as these genes could be targeted to aid in diagnosing and treating disease., A major challenge inusing prognostic associations to identify biologicallyinformative signatures is that in some diseases, random gene sets are associated with prognosis., To address this problem we developed a new method called SignificanceAnalysis of Prognostic Signatures (or SAPS) for theidentification of biologically informative gene sets associ- ated with patient survival., To test the effectiveness of SAPS we use SAPS to perform a subtype-specific meta-analysis of prognostic signatures in large breast and ovarian cancer meta-data sets., This analysis represents the largest of its kind ever performed. Our analyses showthat only a small subset of the gene sets found statisticallysignificant using standard measures achieve significance by SAPS., We identify new prognostic signatures in breast and ovarian cancer and their corresponding molecularsubtypes, and we demonstrate a striking similaritybetween prognostic pathways in ER negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer, suggesting new shared therapeutic targets for these aggressive malignancies.SAPS is a powerful new method for deriving robustprognostic biological pathways from clinically annotated genomic datasets.Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures PLOS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 2 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1002875 Application and Validation We chose two model systems to investigate the performance of SAPS., The first is a curated sample of breast cancer datasets previously described in Haibe-Kains et al. [20]. Our analysis focused on nineteen datasets with patient survival information (total n = 3832) ( Table S1 )., The second dataset was a compen- dium of twelve ovarian cancer datasets with survival data as described in Bentink et al., [21] which includes data from 1735ovarian cancer patients for whom overall survival data were available ( Table S2 )., Identifying Molecular Subtypes In breast cancer we used SCMGENE [20] as implemented in the R/Bioconductor genefu package [22] to assign patients to one of four molecular subtypes, ER +/HER2 2low proliferation,  ER +/ HER22high proliferation, ER 2/HER2 2and HER2 +.I n ovarian cancer, we used the ovcAngiogenic model [21] asimplemented in genefu to classify patients as having disease of either angiogenic or non-angiogenic subtype., Data Scaling and Merging One challenge in the analysis of large published datasets is the heterogeneity of the platforms used to collect data (see Table S1 and Table S2 )., To standardize the data we used normalized log2(intensity) for single-channel platforms and log 2(ratio) in dual- channel platforms., Hybridization probes were mapped to Entrez GeneID as described in Shi et al. [23] using RefSeq and Entrez whenever possible otherwise mapping was performed using IDconverter (http, //idconverter.bioinfo.cnio.es) [24]., When mul- tiple probes mapped to the same Entrez GeneID we used the one with the highest variance in the dataset under study., To allow for simultaneous analysis of datasets from multiple institutions we tested two data merging protocols., First, we scaled and centered each expression feature across all patients in each Figure 1. Overview of SAPS method. The SAPS method computes three P values for a candidate gene set (AC). These P values are summarized in the SAPS score (D) and statistical significance of a SAPS score is estimated by permutation testing (E)., doi 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002875.g001Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures PLOS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 3 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1002875 dataset (standard Zscores), and we merged the scaled data from the different datasets (traditional scaling)., In a second scaling procedure we first assigned each patient in each data set to a breast or ovarian cancer molecular subtype, using the SCMGENE[20] and ovcAngiogenic [21] models,  respectively., We then scaled and centered each expression feature separately within a specificmolecular subtype within each dataset, so that each expression value was transformed into a Z score indicating the level ofexpression within patients of a specific molecular subtype within a dataset (subtype-specific scaling)., After merging datasets we removed genes with missing data in more than half of the samples and we removed samples that were Figure 2., Global breast cancer Venn diagram and scatterplot.

[26] confirms that the gene list is mislabeled in the Molecular Signatures Database and is in fact the set of genes positively associated with metastasis in vant Veer et al., [26] The top-ranking gene sets associated with good prognosis were not originally identified in breast cancers, and represent a range of biological processes., Several were from analyses of hematolym- phoid cells including, genes down-regulated in monocytes isolated from peripheral blood samples of patients with mycosis fungoides compared to those from normal healthy donors, genes associatedwith the IL-2 receptor beta chain in T cell activation, and genes down-regulated in B2264-19/3 cells (primary B lymphocytes) within 60180 min after activation of LMP1 (an oncogeneencoded by Epstein Barr virus)., These gene sets suggest that specific subsets of immune system activation are associated with improved breast cancer prognosis, consistent with reports that the presence infiltrating lymphocytes is predictive of outcome in many cancers., We then applied SAPS to the ER +/HER2 2high proliferation subtype. Of the 5320 gene sets evaluated 1503 (28%) achieved a raw P-Value of 0.05 by P pure, 1667 (31%) by Penrichment ,  1079 (20%) byPrandom,  675 (13%) by all 3 raw P-Values , and all 675 of these are significant at the SAPS q-value of 0.05., The top-ranking gene sets by SAPS scoreare associated with cancer and proliferation. One of the top-ranking gene sets was associated with Ki67 a well-known prognostic marker in Luminal B breast cancers [27]., Overall thepatterns of significance are highly similar to that seen in breast cancer analyzed independent of subtype ( Figure 3, Table 2 )., Next, we used SAPS to analyze the ER +/HER2 2low proliferation samples. Of the 5320 gene sets evaluated 494 (9%) achieved a raw P-Value of 0.05 by P pure, 1113 (21%) by Penrichment ,  939 (18%) by Prandom,  303 (6%) by all 3 raw P-Values , and all 303 of these were significant at the SAPS q-value of 0.05., The top-ranking ER+/HER2 2low proliferation prognostic gene sets by SAPS- score are also highly enriched for genes involved in proliferationTable 1., Top prognostic signatures in global breast cancer.

Of the 5320 gene sets evaluated 1247 (23%) achieved a raw P-Value of 0.05 by Ppure, 1425 (27%) by Penrichment ,  683 (13%) by Prandom ,  439 (8%) by all 3 raw P-Values , and 342 (6%) of these are significant at the SAPS q-value of 0.05., Most of the top-ranking prognostic pathways in the HER2 +group by SAPS scoreare associated with better prognosis and include several gene sets associated with inflammatoryresponse ( Figure 5, Table 4 )., A gene set containing genes down-regulated in multiple myeloma cell lines treated with the hypomethylating agents decitabine and trichostatin A was significantly associated with improved prognosis in HER2 +breast cancer., The top-ranking gene set associated with decreased survival is a hypoxia-associated gene set. Hypoxia is a well-known prognostic factor in breast cancer [2829], and our analysis suggests it shows a very strong association with survival in the HER2 +breast cancer molecular subtype., Finally we used SAPS to analyze the poor-prognosis basal like subtype which was classified as being ER 2/HER2 2., Of the Figure 3. ER +/HER22high proliferation Venn diagram and scatterplot. (A) The gene sets significant by at least one of the P values at the 0.05 level are displayed in a Venn diagram., ( B) The2log10 of the SAPS q-value is plotted on the y-axis and the SAPS score along the x axis for each of the 5320 gene sets in the Molecular Signatures Database for their prognostic significance in the ER +/HER22breast cancer molecular subtype., Each point in the scatterplot represents a gene set and gene sets that achieved a SAPS q-value#0.05 and an absolute value ( SAPS score)$1.3 are colored in red., doi 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002875.g003Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures PLOS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 6 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1002875 5320 gene sets evaluated, 786 (15%) achieved a raw P-Value of 0.05 byPpure,  1208 (23%) by Penrichment , 304 (6%) by Prandom,  126 (2%) by all 3 raw P-Values , and 25 (0.5%) of these are significant at the SAPS q-value of 0.05., Top-ranking gene sets associated with poor survival include genes up-regulated in MCF7 breast cancer cells treated with hypoxia mimetic DMOG, genes down-regulated inMCF7 cells after knockdown of HIF1A and HIF2A, genesregulated by hypoxia based on literature searches, genes up-regulated in response to both hypoxia and overexpression of an active form of HIF1A, and genes down-regulated in fibroblasts with defective XPC (an important DNA damage response protein)in response to cisplatin ( Figure 6, Table 5 )., This analysis suggests that hypoxia-associated gene sets are key drivers of poorprognosis in HER2 +and ER 2/HER2 2breast cancer subtypes., Interestingly cisplatin is an agent with activity in ER 2/HER2 2 breast cancer, and it is has been suggested that ER 2/HER2 2 breast cancers with defective DNA repair may show increasedsusceptibility to cisplatin [30]., Application of SAPS to Ovarian Cancer Our analysis for ovarian cancer was similar to that for breast cancer., We began by applying SAPS to the entire collection of ovarian cancer samples independent of subtype. Of the 5355 genesets evaluated 1190 (22%) achieved a raw P-Value of 0.05 by P pure, 1391 (26%) by Penrichment ,  755 (14%) by Prandom ,  497 (9%) by all 3 raw P-Values (Figure 7, Table 6 ),  and all 497 of these are significant at the SAPS q-value of 0.05., The top gene sets are involved in stem cell-related pathways and pathways related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition, including genes up-regulated in HMLEcells (immortalized non-transformed mammary epithelium) afterE-cadhedrin (CDH1) knockdown by RNAi, genes down-regulated in adipose tissue mesenchymal stem cells vs. bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, genes down-regulated in medullarybreast cancer relative to ductal breast cancer, genes down-regulated in basal-like breast cancer cell lines as compared to the mesenchymal-like cell lines, genes up-regulated in metaplastic carcinoma of the breast subclass 2 compared to the medullarycarcinoma subclass 1, and genes down-regulated in invasive ductalcarcinoma compared to invasive lobular carcinoma., We then analyzed the angiogenic subtype. Of the 5355 gene sets evaluated 1153 (22%) achieved a raw P-Value of 0.05 by P pure, 1377 (26%) by Penrichment ,  624 (12%) by Prandom ,  371 (7%) by all 3 raw P-Values (Figure 7, Table 6 ),  and all of these are significant at the SAPS q-value of 0.05., Top-ranking gene sets associated withpoor prognosis in the angiogenic subtype include a set of targets of miR-33 (associated with poor prognosis) ( Figure 8,  Table 7 )., This microRNA has not previously been implicated in ovariancarcinogenesis. Other top hits include several immune responsegene sets which were associated with improved prognosis., Finally, we analyzed the non-angiogenic subtype of ovarian cancer.

The second cluster comprised a mixture of EMT-associated gene sets gene sets associated with angiogenesis,  and with developmental processes., The third is comprised predominantly of gene sets associated with inflammation. The proliferation cluster of gene sets is strongly associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer overall and ER +breast cancer subtypes., This supports prior studies demonstrating that prolifer-ation is the strongest factor associated with prognosis in breast cancer overall [15] and in its ER +molecular subtypes [6]., Interestingly the proliferation cluster of gene sets shows little association with survival in ER 2/HER2 2and HER2 +breast cancer and ovarian cancer and its subtypes, and it is the EMT,  Figure 4., ER +/HER22low proliferation Venn diagram and scatterplot.

The p value generated from this analysis is thestandard P pure which has been frequently used in the literature to indicate a gene sets clinical and biological relevance for aparticular disease., A key insight of the SAPS method (building onthe work of Venet et al. [15]) is that clinical utility and biological relevance of a gene set are two very different properties, necessitating distinct statistical tests., The P pureassesses the statistical significance of survival differences observed between two groups ofpatients stratified using a candidate gene set, and thus this testprovides insight into the potential clinical utility of a gene set forstratifying patients into prognostically variable groups, however, this statistical test provides no information to compare theprognostic performance of the candidate gene set with randomlygenerated (biologically null) gene sets., We believe that it isessential for a candidate prognostic gene set to not only stratifypatients into prognostically variable groups, but to do so in a waythat is significantly superior to a random gene set of similar size.Therefore, the second condition of the SAPS method is that a geneset must stratify patients significantly more effectively than arandom gene set., This analysis produces the P random . The Prandom directly compares the prognostic association of a candidate geneset with the prognostic association of biologically null random gene sets., Lastly to avoid selecting a gene set that is linked to prognosis solely by the unsupervised k-means clustering procedure, the SAPS procedure additionally requires a prognostic gene set to be enriched for genes that show strong univariate associations with prognosis., Therefore the third condition of the SAPS method isthat a candidate gene set should achieve a statistically significant P enrichment , which is a measure of the statistical significance of a candidate gene sets enrichment with genes showing strongunivariate prognostic associations., Our results in breast and ovarian cancer and their molecular subtypes demonstrate that the P enrichment shows only moderate overall correlation with the Ppureand Prandom (range Spearman rho = (0.230.35), median Spearman rho = 0.30)) and there is only moderate overlap between gene setsidentified at a raw p value of 0.05 by P pure, Prandom ,  and Penrichment (Figures 2A9A)., These data suggest that the Penrichment provides useful additional information to the Ppureand Prandom and allows prioritization of gene sets that are enriched for genes showing strong univariate prognostic associations., Summarizing these three distinct statistical tests into a single score is a difficult task as they were each generated using different methods and they test different hypotheses., We chose to use themaximum as the summary function (as opposed to a median or average for example), as the maximum is a conservative summary measure and it is easily interpretable., It is important to note that the SAPS method provides users with the SAPS scoreas well as all 3 component Pvalues (and the 3 component q-values corrected for multiple hypotheses to control the FDR), and therefore the user can choose to use the SAPS scoreor to focus on a particular SAPS component, as desired for the specific experimental question beingevaluated., Importantly the SAPS method also performs a permutation-test to estimate the statistical significance of gene sets SAPS score., To test the utility of SAPS in providing insight into prognostic pathways in cancer we performed a systematic,  comprehensive, and well-powered analysis of prognostic gene signatures in breast and ovarian cancers and their molecular subtypes., This represents the largest meta-analysis of subtype-specific prognostic pathwaysever performed in these malignancies., The analysis identified new prognostic gene sets in breast and ovarian cancer molecular subtypes and demonstrated significant variability in prognostic associations across the diseases and their subtypes., We find that proliferation drives prognosis in ER +breast cancer while pathways related to hypoxia, angiogenesis,  develop-Table 6., Top prognostic signatures in global ovarian cancer.

Our analysis included 1735 ovarian cancer patients forwhom overall survival data were available ( Table S2 )., Molecular Subtype Classification For breast cancer the SCMGENE model [20] was used in the R/Bioconductor genefu package [22] to stratify patients into four molecular subtypes, ER +/HER2 2low proliferation,  ER +/ HER22high proliferation,  ER 2/HER2 2and HER2 +., In the ovarian datasets we used ovcAngiogenic model [21] as imple-mented in genefu . Creation of Meta-Data Sets For genes with multiple probes we selected the probe with the highest variance., We tested two procedures for merging of datasubtype-specific scaling, and traditional (non subtype-specificscaling) (as described in Data-Scaling and Merging portion ofthe manuscript)., We excluded genes and cases with more than50% of data missing. From these reduced data matrices, we imputed missing values using the impute package in R [32]. These pre-processed meta-data sets are included as Supporting Informa-tion in Dataset S1 for both breast and ovarian cancer usingsubtype-specific and traditional scaling., Gene Sets Gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) [17] (http //www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/collections.jsp)(molsigdb.v3.0.entrez.gmt)., Analyses were limited to gene sets ofsize greater than 1 and less than or equal to 250 genes. Application of the Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures (SAPS) Procedure and Visualization of SAPS P Values The SAPS procedure is described in Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures (SAPS) portion of the manuscript., Brieflyfor a candidate gene set,  SAPS generates 3 component p-values, P pure, Prandom , and Penrichment ., The SAPS scoreis the maximum of these values. The Ppureis the standard log-rank p value computed by performing K-means clustering with a k of 2 and assessing thestatistical significance of the survival difference between the 2resulting clusters, implemented using the survdiff function in the Rpackage survival and extracting the chi-square statistic for a test of equality of the 2 survival curves., To compute the P random w e generate a distribution of Ppurefrom random gene sets (we used 10000 random gene sets for a sequence of 8 gene set sizes ranging from 5 to 250), and we calculate the proportion of random gene sets of a similar size to the candidate gene sets that achieve a Ppure at least as significant as the true Ppure., To compute the Penrichment w e generate .rnk files that include each gene and its concordanceindex for survival, implemented with the function concordan-ce.index in the survcomp R package., These .rnk files are used in a pre-ranked GSEA analysis implemented with the executable jarfile gsea2-2.07 (which is downloadable from, http, //www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/downloads.jsp)., In our analyses we set a maximum gene set size of 250 and used default GSEA parameters.The SAPS scorefor each candidate gene set is then computed as the negative log 10of the maximum of the ( Ppure, Prandom,  and Penrichment ) times the direction of the association (positive or negative)., Thestatistical significance of the SAPS scoreis determined by permuta- tion-testing. Specifically in our experiments, we performed 10000permutations of the gene labels for each of the sequence of 8 of gene set sizes ranging from 5 to 250., We performed the full SAPS procedure for each of the 80000 permuted gene sets and wegenerated a null distribution of 10000 SAPS scoresfor each of the 8 gene set sizes., The SAPS p-value was computed as the proportion of permuted gene sets of a similar size to the candidate gene set that achieved at least as extreme a SAPS score., The SAPS p-values were then converted to SAPS q-values using the method of Benjamini and Hochberg [19]., Hierarchical Clustering Hierarchical clustering was performed on the SAPS scores for breast and ovarian cancer molecular subtypes., Hierarchicalclustering was performed with one minus Spearman rank correlation as the distance metric and complete linkage, using the Cluster 3.0 package (http, //bonsai.hgc.jp/ , mdehoon/ software/cluster/)., Clustering results were visualized using JavaTreeView (http://jtreeview.sourceforge.net/). The Java TreeView files used to generate the Heatmap in Figure 10 are provided in the Supplementary Information (BreastOvary_HC.zip)., An R script and R workspaces for running SAPS on the breast and ovarian cancer meta-data sets and generating Scatterplots and Venn Diagrams of the SAPS P-Values (including all figures from our analyses) are included in in Dataset S1 (http, //dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.mk471)., The Venn diagrams were generated with theVennerable package in R.

      "answer": "The abstract of the paper \"Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures\" discusses the development of a new method called Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures (SAPS) aimed at identifying biologically informative prognostic gene sets in cancer research. The authors highlight that traditional methods of clustering patients based on gene expression data may lead to misleading conclusions, as random gene sets can also show significant outcome stratification. To address this issue, SAPS combines standard prognostic tests with a novel significance test that evaluates the ability of gene sets to stratify patients into prognostically variable groups while ensuring these sets are enriched for genes with strong associations to patient prognosis. The paper reports on a large meta-analysis of prognostic pathways in breast and ovarian cancer, revealing that only a small fraction of gene sets deemed significant by conventional methods also achieved significance through SAPS. The findings indicate that prognostic signatures in ER-negative breast cancer share similarities with those in ovarian cancer, suggesting potential shared therapeutic targets. Overall, SAPS is presented as a robust tool for deriving meaningful prognostic biological signatures from genomic datasets."

      "question": "Describe the methodology used in the paper.",
      "answer": "The methodology used in the paper \"Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures\" involves the development and application of a novel statistical framework called Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures (SAPS). This methodology is designed to identify biologically informative prognostic gene sets associated with patient survival in cancer, specifically breast and ovarian cancer.\n\n### Key Components of the Methodology:\n\n1. **SAPS Framework**:\n   - The SAPS method integrates three distinct statistical tests to evaluate candidate gene sets:\n     - **P_pure**: This p-value assesses the ability of a candidate gene set to cluster patients into groups that exhibit significant survival differences. It is calculated using k-means clustering (k=2) on the gene expression data and a log-rank test to compare survival outcomes.\n     - **P_random**: This p-value evaluates how well the candidate gene set performs compared to random gene sets of similar size. It is computed by generating random gene sets and determining the proportion that achieves a P_pure as significant as that of the candidate gene set.\n     - **P_enrichment**: This p-value indicates whether the candidate gene set is enriched for genes that show strong univariate associations with patient prognosis. It is calculated using a pre-ranked Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) based on the concordance index of genes.\n\n2. **SAPS Score Calculation**:\n   - The SAPS score for each candidate gene set is computed as the negative log10 of the maximum of the three p-values (P_pure, P_random, and P_enrichment), adjusted for the direction of the association (positive or negative). This score summarizes the overall significance of the gene set.\n\n3. **Permutation Testing**:\n   - To assess the statistical significance of the SAPS score, permutation testing is employed. This involves permuting gene labels to create a null distribution of SAPS scores for random gene sets, allowing for the calculation of p-values and q-values (adjusted for multiple testing).\n\n4. **Data Sources**:\n   - The methodology utilizes large meta-analyses of breast and ovarian cancer datasets, including 19 breast cancer datasets (n=3832) and 12 ovarian cancer datasets (n=1735), with survival data available.\n\n5. **Molecular Subtype Classification**:\n   - Patients are classified into molecular subtypes using established models (e.g., SCMGENE for breast cancer and ovcAngiogenic for ovarian cancer) to ensure that analyses are relevant to specific cancer subtypes.\n\n6. **Data Preprocessing**:\n   - The gene expression data undergoes normalization and scaling to account for differences in data collection platforms. Missing values are imputed, and genes with excessive missing data are excluded.\n\n7. **Gene Set Selection**:\n   - Gene sets are sourced from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB), with a focus on sets containing between 1 and 250 genes.\n\n8. **Hierarchical Clustering**:\n   - The methodology includes hierarchical clustering of gene sets based on SAPS scores to identify similarities and differences in prognostic pathways across breast and ovarian cancer subtypes.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe SAPS methodology provides a robust framework for identifying prognostic gene sets that are biologically informative and clinically relevant, addressing limitations in previous approaches that may have overestimated the significance of random gene sets. This approach enhances the understanding of cancer biology and may aid in the identification of new therapeutic targets."

      "question": "What are the key findings of the paper?",
      "answer": "The key findings of the paper \"Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures\" by Andrew H. Beck et al. can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Development of SAPS**: The authors introduced a new statistical method called Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures (SAPS) to rigorously identify biologically informative prognostic gene sets. SAPS integrates standard prognostic tests with a novel significance test that assesses the ability of gene sets to stratify patients into prognostic subtypes compared to random gene sets.\n\n2. **Meta-Analysis of Cancer Data**: SAPS was applied in a large meta-analysis of prognostic pathways in breast and ovarian cancer, which is noted as the largest completed to date. This analysis revealed that only a small subset of gene sets that were statistically significant using standard measures also achieved significance through SAPS.\n\n3. **Identification of New Prognostic Signatures**: The study identified new prognostic signatures in breast and ovarian cancer, highlighting that prognostic signatures in estrogen receptor (ER) negative breast cancer are more similar to those in ovarian cancer than to those in ER positive breast cancer.\n\n4. **Statistical Rigor**: The findings emphasize the necessity of using rigorous statistical methods to differentiate between biologically relevant gene sets and those that may appear significant purely by chance. The SAPS method ensures that significant gene sets not only stratify patients effectively but are also enriched for genes with strong univariate associations with prognosis.\n\n5. **Biological Insights**: The analysis provided insights into the mechanisms driving cancer progression, showing that proliferation is a key factor in ER positive breast cancer prognosis, while pathways related to hypoxia, angiogenesis, and inflammation are more relevant in ER negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer.\n\n6. **Shared Therapeutic Targets**: The results suggest potential shared therapeutic targets between ER negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer, indicating that these malignancies may benefit from similar treatment strategies.\n\nOverall, the paper presents SAPS as a powerful tool for deriving robust prognostic biological signatures from genomic datasets, enhancing the understanding of cancer biology and improving clinical outcomes through better prognostic assessments."

      "answer": "In the study, the data was analyzed using a method called Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures (SAPS). This method integrates standard prognostic tests with a new prognostic significance test that stratifies patients into prognostic subtypes using random gene sets. The analysis involves several key steps:\n\n1. **Three Distinct Significance Tests**: SAPS computes three p-values for a candidate prognostic gene set:\n   - **P_pure**: This p-value is derived from k-means clustering (with k=2) of the gene expression data, followed by a log-rank test to assess survival differences between the two patient groups formed.\n   - **P_random**: This p-value assesses how well the candidate gene set performs compared to random gene sets of similar size.

This score summarizes the significance of the gene set in relation to patient prognosis.\n\n3. **Permutation Testing**: To determine the statistical significance of the SAPS score, permutation testing is performed. This involves permuting the gene labels to create a null distribution of SAPS scores, allowing for the calculation of a p-value based on how many permuted scores are as extreme as the observed score.\n\n4. **Multiple Hypothesis Correction**: The study also accounts for multiple hypotheses by controlling the false discovery rate using the Benjamini-Hochberg method, resulting in SAPS q-values.\n\n5. **Meta-Analysis**: The SAPS method was applied to a large meta-analysis of breast and ovarian cancer datasets, allowing for the identification of prognostic gene sets across different molecular subtypes.\n\nOverall, the analysis combines rigorous statistical methods to ensure that identified gene sets are not only statistically significant but also biologically informative in relation to cancer prognosis."

    {
      "question": "Was the data in the study pre-processed in anyway? If so how?",
      "answer": "Yes, the data in the study was pre-processed in several ways:\n\n1. **Data Standardization**: The authors standardized the data by using normalized log2(intensity) for single-channel platforms and log2(ratio) for dual-channel platforms. This step was crucial to ensure consistency across different datasets collected from various platforms.\n\n2. **Gene Mapping**: Hybridization probes were mapped to Entrez GeneID using RefSeq and Entrez databases. If multiple probes mapped to the same Entrez GeneID, the probe with the highest variance in the dataset was selected.\n\n3. **Data Merging Protocols**: Two data merging protocols were tested:\n   - **Traditional Scaling**: Each expression feature was scaled and centered across all patients in each dataset (standard Z-scores), and then the scaled data from different datasets were merged.\n   - **Subtype-Specific Scaling**: Patients were first assigned to a molecular subtype, and then each expression feature was scaled and centered separately within each subtype before merging the datasets.\n\n4. **Missing Data Handling**: Genes with missing data in more than half of the samples were removed, as well as samples that had missing data on more than half of the genes or lacked information on survival outcomes. The remaining missing values were estimated using the `knn.impute` function from the impute package in R.\n\nThese pre-processing steps were essential for preparing the data for the subsequent analyses using the Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures (SAPS) method."

      "question": "Can you provide a summary of the literature review from the paper?",
      "answer": "The literature review in the paper \"Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures\" discusses the challenges and advancements in identifying biological signatures that predict cancer prognosis, particularly in breast cancer. It highlights the traditional approach of clustering patients based on gene expression data from prognostic gene sets, which has been called into question by recent findings indicating that random gene sets can also produce significant outcome stratification. This raises concerns about the biological relevance of gene sets associated with prognosis.\n\nThe authors reference previous studies, including work by Venet et al., which demonstrated that many random gene sets can separate breast cancer cases into groups with significant survival differences. This suggests that the association of a gene set with prognosis does not necessarily imply its biological significance. Consequently, the authors argue for the need for more rigorous statistical methods to identify biologically informative prognostic gene sets.\n\nTo address these issues, the authors introduce their method, Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures (SAPS), which integrates standard prognostic tests with a new significance test that assesses the ability of gene sets to stratify patients into prognostically variable groups compared to random gene sets. The literature review emphasizes the importance of developing robust statistical frameworks to enhance the reliability of prognostic signatures in cancer research, ultimately aiming to improve patient stratification and therapeutic targeting."

Future research could explore its utility in various genomic contexts.\n\n4. **Encouragement of Rigorous Statistical Methods**: They advocate for the broader adoption of rigorous statistical methods like SAPS in the identification of prognostic gene sets, suggesting that researchers should be encouraged (or required) to apply such methods before reporting prognostic gene sets.\n\n5. **Subtype-Specific Analyses**: The authors stress the importance of conducting subtype-specific analyses to gain deeper insights into the biological mechanisms driving cancer progression and prognosis, which could lead to more tailored therapeutic approaches.\n\nThese directions aim to enhance the understanding of cancer biology and improve the identification of prognostic biomarkers, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes."

The clustering helps in assessing survival differences between the groups.\n\n2. **Log-rank Test**: A log-rank p-value (Ppure) is computed to evaluate the statistical significance of survival differences between the two patient groups formed by k-means clustering.\n\n3. **Permutation Testing**: This method is used to estimate the statistical significance of the SAPS score. The authors perform permutations of gene labels to create a null distribution for the SAPS score, allowing them to compute the proportion of random gene sets achieving at least as extreme a score as the candidate gene set.\n\n4. **Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)**: The study employs a pre-ranked GSEA approach to compute the enrichment of candidate gene sets for genes that show strong univariate associations with prognosis. This involves ranking genes based on their concordance index and assessing the overrepresentation of candidate gene sets at the extremes of this ranking.\n\n5. **False Discovery Rate Control**: The authors apply the Benjamini and Hochberg method to control the false discovery rate when evaluating multiple hypotheses, generating SAPS q-values from the raw p-values.\n\nThese techniques collectively contribute to the development of the Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures (SAPS) method, which aims to identify biologically informative prognostic gene sets by ensuring that they not only stratify patients into prognostically variable groups but also outperform random gene sets in this stratification."

      "question": "What are the implications of the research findings?",
      "answer": "The research findings from the paper \"Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures\" have several important implications:\n\n1. **Need for Rigorous Statistical Methods**: The study highlights the inadequacy of traditional methods for identifying prognostic gene sets in cancer research. It demonstrates that many random gene sets can appear to stratify patients into prognostically variable groups, which questions the validity of using simple statistical associations to infer biological significance. This calls for the development and application of more rigorous statistical methods, such as the Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures (SAPS) introduced in the study.\n\n2. **Identification of Robust Prognostic Signatures**: The SAPS method allows for the identification of biologically informative prognostic gene sets that are not only statistically significant but also enriched for genes with strong univariate associations with patient prognosis. This can lead to more reliable prognostic markers that can be used in clinical settings to predict patient outcomes.\n\n3. **Insights into Cancer Biology**: The findings reveal that prognostic signatures in different cancer types, particularly breast and ovarian cancers, can share common biological pathways. For instance, the study found that prognostic signatures in ER-negative breast cancer are more similar to those in ovarian cancer than to ER-positive breast cancer. This suggests potential shared therapeutic targets and highlights the importance of understanding the underlying biology of different cancer subtypes.\n\n4. **Implications for Treatment Strategies**: The identification of distinct prognostic pathways associated with different molecular subtypes of breast and ovarian cancer can inform treatment strategies. For example, the study suggests that pathways related to hypoxia and inflammation are significant in certain subtypes, which could lead to targeted therapies that address these specific biological processes.\n\n5. **Encouragement for Subtype-Specific Analyses**: The research emphasizes the importance of conducting subtype-specific analyses in cancer research. The variability in prognostic associations across different subtypes indicates that a one-size-fits-all approach may not be effective. Tailoring analyses to specific molecular subtypes can yield more relevant and actionable insights.\n\n6. **Future Research Directions**: The findings encourage further exploration of the commonalities between different cancer types, particularly in terms of shared prognostic pathways. This could lead to novel therapeutic approaches that leverage these shared mechanisms, ultimately improving patient outcomes.\n\nIn summary, the implications of the research findings underscore the necessity for advanced statistical methodologies in cancer prognostics, the potential for shared therapeutic targets across cancer types, and the importance of subtype-specific analyses in understanding cancer biology and improving treatment strategies."
