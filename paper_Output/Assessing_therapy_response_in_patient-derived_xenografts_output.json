Commonly used measures include modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST) area under the curve (AUC) (2 ),  angle of response (Angle) (2), and tumor growth inhibition (TGI) (35)., Depending on which measure a researcher selects the assessment of response may yield different, often opposite,  conclusions, as none of the existing measures take full advantage of the data collected across replicates., For example mRECIST (1) is easy to compute but does not take controls into account and is thus unable to distinguish true disease control (stable disease) from a naturally slow-growing tumor., The angle of response and TGI only take into account the last mea- surement rather than the full trajectory of treatment., AUC angle of response,  and TGI measures ignore variance in the replicate experiments, depending only on the mean across replicates., These limitations often lead to an overoptimistic assessment of response. Heterogeneity among PDX replicates can hamper the accurate evaluation of drug efficacy. Previous work (1  5) shows that sub- stantial heterogeneity exists within in vivo PDX studies, with up to 33% of individual replicates mRECIST classifications not matching the majority response classification in (1) and up to 50% in (5)., To have a reliable estimate of treatment response this heterogeneity needs to be taken into account by the response measure., In this work we sought to develop an approach to reliably estimate treatment response in in vivo drug screening experiments., We first show how multiple sources of variation lead to erroneous response calls. We then propose a new response measure KuLGaP [based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between Gaussian processes (GPs)] to account for both experimental controls and variation among replicates., We tested and compared KuLGaP to four widely used response measures using 329 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and demonstrate that the robustness of KuLGaP allows for experimental designs with fewer animal replicates without noticeable loss in the accuracy of response quantification.1Departement AOTI, Universite du Quebec a Montreal,  Montreal,  QC H2X3X2,  Canada., 2Group for Research in Decision Analysis (GERAD), Montreal, QC H3T1J4, Canada. 3Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S2E4, Canada. 4Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Toronto, ON M5G1M1, Canada. 5Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON M5G1X8, Canada. 6Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON M5G1L7, Canada. 7Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5G1L7, Canada. 8Pulmonology Department, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, 67200 Strasbourg, France. 9Laboratory of Molecular Mechanisms of the Stress Response and Pathologies INSERM U1113, 3 Avenue Moliere,  67200 Strasbourg,  France., 10Crown Bioscience Taicang Inc., No.6 Beijing West Road, Taicang, Jiangsu 215400, P.

Med. 13 eabf4969 (2021) 17 November 2021 SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE | RESEARCH ARTICLE2 of 10RESULTS KuLGaP, a measure for in vivo therapy response To illustrate the benefits and pitfalls of various measures assessing drug responses using PDXs, we collected tumor growth curves from 329 PDX models across nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), colorectal, and breast cancers (table S1) and compared our KuLGaP growth response measure to other commonly used response measures, mRECIST (1),  AUC (6),  angle of response (Angle) (2),  and TGI (35) (Fig., 1). There are two steps to computing KuLGaP. First two GP models (7) are fitted to the PDX tumor growth curves, one for treated PDXs and another for controls., Second, the distance between these two GP models using KL divergence is computed (8). An overview of this process is captured in Fig. 1. The benefit of using the GP models is that they model not only the covariance of measurements across time (7) but also the variance within a group of replicates over time., The KL divergence that we use to compare treated replicates and controls is often used in machine learning and mathematical fields to measure the difference between two distributions, as KL has a strong theoretical foundation in informa- tion theory (9) and can be quickly computed for many distributions (10), including the Gaussian distribution., We assessed the statistical significance of the distance between treatment and control arms by computing an empirical null distri- bution of distances between all pairs of controls in our dataset., Using this empirical distribution we computed the significance (P value) of treatment response for each PDX model., Models with a P value less than 0.05 were considered to have a statistically significant dis- tance and classified as responders., The critical value according to our empirical distribution was 7.97. We also calcu- lated the critical values for the 0.1 and 0.01 confidence thresholds to be 5.61 and 13.9, respectively., The computa- tion of KuLGaP is illustrated in Fig. 1 and is described in depth in Materials and Methods. Comparison of measures for therapy response We performed a comparative analysis of KuLGaP with mRECIST, AUC,  Angle,  and TGI., For each pair of measures we computed the agreement between them as the percentage of experiments for which both measures gave the same clas - sification (responder or nonresponder) (Fig., 2A), the false discovery rate of each measure with respect to each other (Fig. 2B) and the number of measures that classified an experiment as a re- sponder compared to the KuLGaP sta - tistic (Fig., 2C). Out of the 329 experiments (with a total of 1437 treatment and 1946 control arms) KuLGaP classified 48 as respond - ers (14.6%),  compared to 133 (40.4%) for TGI, 187 (56.8%) for mRECIST,  199 (60.4%) for AUC,  and 211 (64.1%) for Angle (data file S1)., Briefly TGI and Angle depend on the ratio of the differ- ence between the first and last growth measurement of treatment and control, AUC calculates the cumulative differ- ence at each measurement point be- tween control and treatment groups, mRECIST categorizes observation of growth in the treatment arm into complete response (mCR), partial response (mPR),  stable disease (mSD),  and progressive disease (mPD)., Following established practice (11 13), we considered all PDX A B EC D Fig. 1.

(A) The human tumor is implanted in a set of mouse replicates [patient-derived xenografts (PDX)] some of which are treated with a given drug (cases,  in red),  and some are not (controls, in blue)., In addition to KuLGaP we also evaluated four different measures commonly used to assess response status in PDXs., (B and C) Tumor volumes of each replicate are normalized to the volume at the starting day of the treatment (here, it is day 34) and log-transformed., (D ) A Gaussian process (GP) is fitted to the treatment and the control group of replicates.

Med. 13 eabf4969 (2021) 17 November 2021 SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE | RESEARCH ARTICLE3 of 10with a TGI value of more than 0.6 to be responders., The measures that gave the most similar results were AUC and Angle. Our KuLGaP measure yielded results that were most similar to TGI The two clas- sifications agreed on responders and nonresponders in 70% of all cases., Overall, KuLGaP was more conservative than all other re- sponse measures (Fig. 2B), as indicated by fewer responders called compared to other methods. For example all but 4 experiments that were classified as responders by KuLGaP (92%) were also responders according to mRECIST, whereas only 31 of 147 mRECIST responders were also responders according to KuLGaP., Similarly all but two of the KuLGaP responders were called as responders by Angle and AUC, but each of these measures called many KuLGaP-nonresponders as responders (145 for AUC and 165 for Angle)., Figure 2C shows that there was substantial disagreement between the different measures. However KuLGaP captured the majority of experiments for which there was a consensus among the other measures., Further, we compared the continuous measures underlying TGI and KL classifications. We found that the Spearman rank correlation coeffi - cient between TGI and the logarithm of the KL divergence was 0.69., Importance of the control group We found that the information contained in the control replicates is crucial for an accurate response classification., A downside of the mRECIST classification is that it does not consider the control group but makes a classification based on the treatment group alone., The mRECIST criterion rates each treatment replicate as either mCR mPR,  mSD,  or mPD, and then classifies the experiment by a majority vote of all the replicates where all but mPD ratings are considered a responder (1 )., We show an extreme example of how over-optimistic mRECIST would be if mSD were also considered a responder (fig., S1). Consider the following two NSCLC PDX models (14): model 1 (Fig. 3, A to C) treated with afatinib and model 2 (Fig. 3, D to F) treated with erlotinib. The mRECIST framework reports mSD for all replicates of both models result- ing in a responder call for both models, whereas KuLGaP called a significant response for model 2 but not model 1., Because mRECIST does not take into account the control group it missed the fact that the cancer in the untreated arm grew as fast as in the treated arm in model 1 but not in model 2., Therefore the mRECIST classification was the same for both models, despite the clear differences in response., Both the AUC and Angle classifications agreed with the KuLGaP classification in both cases whereas TGI classified both models as nonresponders., Because TGI does not consider the length of time for which the treated sample is not growing it failed to detect the tumor arrest in model 2., In model 2 the treatment arm of this model took about 50 days longer to reach the maximum tumor size of its control replicates, and this effect was detected by our KuLGaP approach., For model 1 (Fig. 3, A to C), we observed a particularly over- optimistic responder call by mRECIST. An intuitive way to alter the mRECIST classification to be more conservative is to consider only the mCR and mPR ratings as a positive response., However this leads to considerable loss of sensitivity, as demonstrated in fig. S2. The simple alteration cannot fix a fundamental mRECIST flaw. Furthermore we evaluated a colorectal cancer PDX with eight control and eight treatment replicates treated with evofosfamide (fig., S3). All measures apart from KuLGaP classified this model as a responder. The mRECIST measure failed to take into account that the treatment and control groups grew at a similar pace, whereas Angle and AUC only consider the last day of measurement and therefore missed the greater similarity of the treatment and control growth curves throughout the experiment., We provide an additional example using empirical data to support our claims in fig. S3 (D to F). Accounting for variance among replicates Accounting for the variance among replicates leads to greater selec- tivity in declaring a response., An illustration of this scenario is given by the breast cancer PDX experiment with 15 paclitaxel-treated and AC B Fig., 2.

Although there was a substantial difference in the means between the control and treat- ment groups (Fig., 4B), there was also substantial variance among replicates in each group (Fig. 4A). TGI, similarly to mRECIST, AUC, and Angle measures, classified this model as a responder. KuLGaP takes into account the variance among replicates and shows that the variance within control and treatment arms is big enough to remove the significance of the mean difference, thus classifying this model as a nonresponder., Next consider the following experiment, where 10 replicates of an NSCLC PDX model were treated with dacomitinib (Fig., 4, D to F). The Angle and AUC measures which do not take into account vari- ance, identified this PDX model as a responder., Our KuLGaP measure picked up on the fact that the variance among replicates in the treatment and control groups was larger than the mean difference between the two groups and therefore declared the experiment a nonresponder., In other words, incorporation of variance led to greater selectivity in declaring response. The TGI measure concurs with the KuLGaP assessment of a nonresponder. The mRECIST classification (which does not consider the control group) is stable disease (mSD) and thus,  the model is erroneously considered responsive., An additional example shows an experiment where even a large difference between the mean growth of the treatment and control arms can be deceptive (fig., S4). Upon closer inspection of the individual replicates it is clear that any difference in the mean behavior is dwarfed by the large variance, leading to a false-positive call by all measures but KuLGaP., Implications of not considering multiple replicates in the study design The experimental design of xenograft experiments usually requires the researcher to collect responses from multiple replicates of the model treated with the drug comparing them to those that are treat- ment naive (controls)., Because PDX experiments are laborious a 1  1  1 experimental design was proposed (1 ), where only a single replicate is used per drug and model., By testing and publishing a dataset on 1000 PDXs the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research Patient-Derived Xenograft Encyclopedia (NIBR PDXE) study greatly contributed to research in this area., Unfortunately, this experimental design has its limitations. In this setup the researchers were able to gain insight into the population-level response for a given drug., However this design is not sufficient to draw conclusions for an in- dividual patient/PDX level due to the absence of the variability that can only be derived from the replicates of the same PDX (15)., The lack of accounting for the variance in the 1  1  1 design is particularly detrimental for the mRECIST classification used in the study (1 )., It is common for different replicates to have different mRECIST classifications.

Transl. Med. 13 eabf4969 (2021) 17 November 2021 SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE | RESEARCH ARTICLE5 of 10with five treatment replicates (fig., S5). Two of the five replicates were classified as mPR, two as mSD, and one as mPD. Depending on the one randomly chosen replicate in the n = 1 design the classi- fications would have been different., This scenario is common because the mRECIST classification is often decided early on in the experiment when tumors are smaller and therefore more suscepti- ble to measurement errors and noise., In our dataset we found that fewer than 30% (97 of 329) of the models had the same mRECIST classification across replicates., Almost 60% (197 of 329) of the models had two different mRECIST classifications of which 39 models (11% of the total) had mRECIST classifications that were not adjacent (such as mCR and mSD)., In 10% (32 of 329) of the models treatment replicates were assigned three different mRECIST classifications such that almost half (160 of 329) of the models had a majority decision supported by fewer than 75% of that models replicates., Consequently we postulate that the NIBR PDXE study using the 1  1  1 design with mRECIST criterion is likely to be unreliable for personalized treatment prediction in many clinical scenarios., Assessing a study design with fewer replicates There is a substantial downside to having only a single replicate per experiment., However, a large number of replicates increase both the cost and the use of research animals. We performed an experi- ment to see whether a smaller number of replicates would achieve reliable results., For each experiment we randomly sampled without replacement three treatment and three control replicates and computed KuLGaP, mRECIST,  Angle,  AUC,  and TGI classifications based on this subsample., This was repeated three times. Thus, for each model, we obtained three sets of experiments with three repli- cates each. By comparing the responses using only three replicates to those obtained using the full set of replicates, we were able to estimate how robust each response measure is to a reduced number of replicates., We found that KuLGaP and TGI measures were particularly robust to this form of subsampling reaching agreements of 95.9 and 94.1% between reduced and original sets., The other measures were less robust, reaching 87.9% (mRECIST), 86.6% (Angle), and 79.9% (AUC). This suggests that it may be possible to reduce the number of replicates to 3 when studying drug response if necessary., We further found that one replicate was insufficient to estimate variance across the data (fig. S6). We have seen that good estimates for the inter-replicate variability are important. Obtaining such estimates can be done better with six or more replicates and we therefore encourage the experimenters to continue PDX experiments with more replicates to maintain higher accuracy when possible., Clinical relevance of KuLGaP We compared the cisplatin-vinorelbine combination treatment response in PDXs to data from 13 corresponding patients with NSCLC receiving adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy., For each AB DEC AngleAUCmRECISTTGIKuLGaPResponder MeasureFAngleAUCmRECISTTGIKuLGaPResponder MeasureTreatment ControlTreatment Control Treatment ControlTreatment Control Fig., 4.

Med. 13 eabf4969 (2021) 17 November 2021 SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE | RESEARCH ARTICLE6 of 10of these patients, we considered both the time to recurrence and the growth curves of the corresponding PDX., The time to recurrence was measured from the time of starting adjuvant chemotherapy to either recurrence or last follow-up., We found that among patients whose corresponding PDX models were classified as responders by KuLGaP the mean time to recurrence was 4.13 years, compared to 1.02 years in the group of nonresponders according to KuLGaP., The difference (3.11 years) was the highest compared to all other methods (Table 1). We found substantial disagreement between the measures which showed unanimity between responders in only four cases (three responders and one nonresponder)., Because of the small sample size it was difficult to assess statisti- cal significance of our clinical validation., However the fact that there was a substantial difference in survival of the patients KuLGaP predicted as PDX responders compared to other methods is encouraging in terms of clinical relevance of our measure compared to all other currently used approaches., DISCUSSION The problem of drug response prediction is incredibly important for the field of precision medicine, and yet,  it is far from being solved,  still fraught with many obstacles., PDXs are an appealing paradigm for drug response studies due to their ability to potentially act as a realistic simulation of a given patient and model the spec- trum of clinical disease., Among their many applications PDXs can be used both for predicting response for individual patients through empiric drug treatment and for identifying biomarker-response relationships across heterogeneous collections representing the patient populations., In each use case efficient testing of many indi- vidual PDX models and drugs and accurate drug response quanti- fication are of critical importance., In the former false-positive or false-negative predictions have a major impact, as patients have a limited opportunity for treatment, and avoidance of ineffective toxic therapy is crucial., In the latter accurate response calls are necessary to identify or validate predictive biomarkers that can be used to guide patient selection or companion diagnostic development in clinical trials., Our work shows that none of the currently widely used response quantification measures take into account the full extent of the available experimental data, some ignore controls,  and others ignore variation among replicates., Grounded in real data and making the fewest assumptions about regularity of measurements and the number and variability of replicates, we derived a measure,  KuLGaP,  that provides a theoretically sound solution to this problem., We have shown KuLGaP to be more selective on a large set of PDXs and more concordant with patient outcomes than four commonly used measures in a small study., Our exploration of real-world examples provides an insight into how we could improve other existing measures as well., For exam- ple one way to make the mRECIST measure more selective would be to include mSD in the nonresponder category., Unfortunately this leads to false-negative classifications, An extreme example of this is illustrated in fig., S2. The TGI measure is one of the widely used measures in the biomedical literature. Like the most commonly used measures TGI is computed on the basis of the mean value of the replicates and then thresholded, especially in cases when the number of replicates is small and therefore fails to take into account the variation between replicates., As discussed above, this can have a substantial impact on the resulting classification. Moreover the TGI criterion only takes the first and last measurements into account and is therefore highly susceptible to measurement errors and fluctuations in the tumor size at the specific time points., One way to introduce at least some impact of the variance would be to calculate TGI individually for each control-treatment replicate pair and apply a suitable statistical test., However this approach would not work well in models with relatively few replicates per model, be- cause this would lead to a low power in the statistical testing., To reduce the impact of a measurement error at the end of the experi- ment one could calculate the TGI criterion based on a few of the measurement points and then take a consensus measure., Although it may result in an improvement this solution will still suffer from not considering the variance across time points., Note that we have not compared KuLGaP to event-free survival or other metrics of durability of response., This is because KuLGaP like AUC and TGI, is a classification measure of response to treatment and not compa- rable to survival metrics., There are limitations to this study. In every analysis presented in this paper the tumor growth curves were truncated at the time point the first mouse was sacrificed., Although this approach may lead to some loss of information it is needed for consistent com- parison of the response-calling methods., Overall a median of 7 days were removed from the experiments and more than 40% of the growth curves required no truncation at all., If a mouse is sacrificed for reasons unrelated to the experiment and effect of the treatment the experimenter may choose to remove it before applying the response-calling pipeline and avoid premature truncation., A second potential limitation is that unlike the methods that do not take variability among replicates into account and can thus be used in scenarios where there is only one replicate available, KuLGaP Table 1., Patient stratification by corresponding PDX response.

As our results on a reduced number of replicates show KuLGaP still performs well when there are only three replicates in the treat- ment and control arms., Although we certainly recommend a larger number of replicates we would not advise a smaller number of replicates than three so that the inter-replicate variation can still be reliably estimated., Overall in our experience, there is no substitute for a measure that models all of the available data simultaneously, taking advantage of the multiple replicates for cases and controls, KuLGaP fulfills these criteria., In addition, KuLGaP can be used to compare the difference between any two treatment groups. For example it could be applied to comparing combination and single- agent treatments to detect potential additive or synergistic effects in combination therapies., We expect that introducing such a measure will lead to more faithful predictions of clinical outcomes and biomarker-response relationships., We have thus created a simple-to- use web interface to assess the response for any PDX clinical experi - ments, kulgap.ca,  that is equally easy to use for both clinicians,  technicians,  and biostatisticians, which we hope will result in wide uptake and reproducible results across drug response research., MATERIALS AND METHODS Study design In this study we introduced a measure of tumor response,  KuLGaP, to account for., We tested and compared KuLGaP to four widely used response measures using 329 PDX models obtained from previously published studies of lung, breast,  and colon cancers in Canada and a variety of cancers in China., Each PDX model experi- ment consisted of several replicates of mice that were assigned randomly to treatment and control groups., The number of repli- cates varied between 3 and 16 mice per group in each model. For the purposes of this study, each mouse is represented by its tumor growth curve. Data preparation At each measured time point of an experiment we took tumor volume estimated from the tumor dimensions as the observed treat- ment response., The first day of drug administration was designated as the initial point of the experiment and we studied the growth curves from that point onward., Curves were truncated to end at the time point where the first mouse (control or treatment) was sacri- ficed, allowing for consistent comparison., Next the growth curve of each PDX replicate in both treatment and control arms was log- normalized to tumor size at the starting day of the treatment., For all measures considered in this paper the treatment response was then assessed from these truncated log-normalized curves., Although truncation at the time where the first mouse was sacri- ficed can be a limiting factor we note that our methodology can be extended to allow for a different truncation., For example if the research team knows that a mouse was sacrificed for a reason that is unrelated to the tumor treatment, this mouse can be removed from the response assessment (as is commonly done in practice already)., Furthermore KuLGaP can be applied multiple times within the same experiment, at the time of the first mouse sacrifice, at the time of the second mouse sacrifice (without the first mouse),  and so on., However, this latter approach should be performed with care for three reasons. First if KuLGaP is applied repetitively to the same experiment, the researchers will have to manually correct for multi- ple hypotheses testing., This is possible to do even using our online implementation as we provide a table with P values in addition to the response/nonresponse calls., Second we have shown that a too small number of replicates lead to an unsafe estimation of the variance, so we do not recommend applying it when the number of replicates drops below three., Third there is a variance-bias trade- off that is in effect here,  The fewer replicates used, the less confident the response call will be., KuLGaP There are two steps to computing KuLGaP. In the first, two GP models (7 ) are fitted: one for tumor treated PDX and one for controls. In the second step we compute a symmetrized integrated version of the KL divergence between the two GP models called KL divergence., KL is frequently used to compute the distance between two distributions. We assessed the significance of divergence be- tween two models by computing KL divergences between all pairs of controls., Using this empirical distribution of divergences we computed P values of significance of response for each PDX model., Models with a P value less than 0.05 that were considered to have a statistically significant KL divergence were classified as responders., GPs provide two major benefits in tumor growth modeling over a simpler statistical model such as the multivariate normal distri- bution., First the tumor size measurements are not evenly spread out in time,  that is, the time that has passed between two measure- ments is not constant., Second the tumor sizes may not always be measured on the same set of days between various experiments., Although the measurements were mostly aligned between cases and controls for each experiment it does not hold for many control- to- control comparisons we need to evaluate to compute the empirical null distribution of KL values, that is,  to establish what differences between experiments are not statistically significant., A further advantage of using GPs is that our model can handle missing mea- surements and estimate the tumor size between measurements in a statistically sound manner., When adding these desiderata to a multivariate normal model, we naturally arrive at a GP. Before our work GPs have been successfully used in other biomedical con- texts, particularly for patient trajectory modeling and forecasting (1618)., Gaussian processes Recall that a set of random variables X 1 ..., X k is said to be jointly Gaussian with mean vector   Rk and covariance matrix   Rk  k if the joint density of X 1, ...,  X k is given by f X 1 , ...,  X k ( x 1 ,  ... , x k ) = (2) k/2    1/2 exp (  1  2 (x  ) T  1 (x   ) ) A GP (7) on an interval [0, T] with mean process m ,  [0,  T]  R and covariance kernel K ,  [0,  T]  [0, T]  R can be considered as an infinite-dimensional analog of the joint Gaussian distribution and is formally defined as a random function X , [0,  T]  R such that for any 0 < t 1 < ... < t k < T the joint distribution of (X(t 1),  ..., X(t 1)) is Gaussian with mean vector (m(t 1),  ...,  m(t k)) and covari- ance matrix ,  where  i, j = K(t i,  tj) for all i,  j.

Med. 13 eabf4969 (2021) 17 November 2021 SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE | RESEARCH ARTICLE8 of 10Given a collection of measurements such as tumor sizes mea- sured for each replicate in a PDX experiment, separately for treat- ment and control,  and a prior GP, one can use Bayes theorem to find the posterior distribution of the underlying tumor growth given the noisy observed data points [see also chapter 6.4 in (19)]., This was implemented using the GPy package (20) (http://github.com/ SheffieldML/GPy). Because of its universality (21) and for theoretical reasons (7) the radial basis function was chosen as the prior distri- bution, with a variance of 1 and a length scale of 10., This choice for a prior kernel leads to good fits of the data for the posterior distri- bution. Hyperparameter selection was performed by maximizing the likelihood using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shannon algo - rithm provided by the package, with seven restarts for each model., The schematic for our data analysis pipeline is given in Fig. 1. KL divergence and KuLGaP The KL divergence (8 ) (also called relative entropy) between two probability measures P and Q on a set  is given by D KL (P  Q ) =  X log dP  dQ dP This is not symmetric, and it will be more convenient to work with the symmetrized version D SKL (P, Q ) = D KL (P  Q ) + D KL (Q  P) For two random processes,  that is, sequences of probability mea- sures ( t,  t ,  t  [0,  T]) indexed by a time interval, we define the integrated symmetrized KL divergence between them as D ISKL (,   ) = 0 T D SKL(  t , t ) dt Consider now a particular PDX experiment with a given drug D,  lasting a total of T days., We proceed as follows First, fit a GP each to the treatment and the control replicates and denote their dis- tributions by T = ( tT , t  [0,  T]) and C = ( tC ,  t  [0,  T]),  respec- tively, and compute the integrated KL divergence D ISKL(T,  C) between them., This quantity can be considered as a continuous estimate of the effect of drug D The larger the KL divergence, the further away the treatment and control replicates are to one another, and therefore the larger an effect by drug D. To test whether an observed KL value corresponded to a success- ful anticancer therapy, we tested the null hypothesis H 0 that the treatment and control GPs did not differ significantly against the alternative hypothesis H 1 that they did differ., We chose to estimate the distribution of a KL divergence under H 0 empirically as follows. Because each control group did not receive any treatment it is reasonable to assume that there was no effect., Therefore we esti- mated the null distribution by computing empirical distribution by calculating the KL divergence between any pair of control groups from the NSCLC and colorectal PDX., This discrete distribution was then smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with bandwidth 0.27 which was selected via leave-one-out cross-validation by the statsmodels Python module (22)., Last the KuLGaP measurement is calculated as the probability of obtaining a KL divergence value at least as large as the one obtained in the experiment (right tail probability/one-sided P value)., Specifically we have calculated a critical value K crit such that the probability of exceeding this value according to the null distribution was higher than a specified confidence level, in our case 0.05., Thus an experiment was classified as a responder according to KuLGaP if and only if its KL divergence value was higher than K crit., The observed values and our estimate of the probability distribution are illustrated in fig. S7. Modified RECIST The RECIST (23) is a framework of guidelines for evaluation of tumor response to anticancer therapies, based on linear dimensions of tumor lesions., Four classifications are possible from the best to the worst outcome,  complete response (CR), partial response (PR),  stable disease (SD),  and progressive disease (PD)., The modified RECIST (mRECIST) (1 ) allows the classification based on tumor volume growth curves. For each time t we determined the relative volume change of the tumor with respect to its reference size V 0, that is,  we calculated  Vt = (Vt  V 0)/V 0., The BestResponse is defined (1 ) to be the minimal value of V t for all times t after 3 days. Further, the running average of V 0, V 1, ..., V t is calculated. The minimal value of this running average is called (1 ) BestAvgResponse. The quantities BestResponse and BestAvgResponse are then used to obtain the mRECIST classification using the following thresholds,   BestResponse < 95% and BestAvgResponse < 40%, mCR (modified complete response),   BestResponse < 50% and BestAvgResponse < 20%, mPR (modified partial response),   BestResponse < 35% and BestAvgResponse < 30%, mSD (modified stable disease),   BestResponse > 35% or BestAvgResponse > 30%, mPD (modified progressive disease)., Because the mRECIST criterion does not take into account the presence of multiple replicates an mRECIST value is calculated for each replicate and a majority vote among replicate classifications is taken., Following (1 ) an mRECIST classification of mPD was considered as a nonresponder, while all others were considered as responders., It should be noted that by definition, mRECIST is not able to take into account the evolution over time (because it only considers the smallest observation) or the variation between replicates., Area under the curve As in (2) the AUC under each replicate in the treatment and con- trol groups was calculated., Then P values for group comparisons based on AUC were calculated using a one-tailed nonparametric Mann-Whitney test., A significance threshold of P < 0.05 was used to classify each PDX model as either a responder (significant difference) or a nonresponder (no significant difference)., Response angle For each replicate in the treatment and control groups the angle between the best fit according to ordinary least squares (OLS) re- gression of the normalized tumor curve and the line y = 1 was calculated., Then the same statistical test as described for the AUC was applied to compare pairwise mean angles of response ( 2), yielding a classification of each PDX model as either a responder (sig - nificant difference) or a nonresponder (no significant difference)., Tumor growth inhibition The TGI is computed as follows TGI = 1   y T _  y C =  y C   y T _  y C , where yC and  yT denote the mean difference between last and first measurement for the control and treatment groups, respectively ( 5)., Downloaded from https://www.science.org on November 20, 2023 Ortmann et al., Sci.

For KuLGaP, a one-sided test against the KL null distribution was calculated. For AUC and response angle, a one-tailed nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was applied.

      "answer": "The methodology used in the paper by Ortmann et al. (2021) involves the development and validation of a new measure called KuLGaP for assessing therapy response in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of cancer. Here is a detailed description of the methodology:\n\n1. **Study Design**: The authors collected tumor growth data from 329 PDX models derived from various cancer types, including non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), colorectal cancer, and breast cancer. Each PDX model consisted of multiple mouse replicates assigned to treatment and control groups.\n\n2. **Data Preparation**: Tumor volumes were measured at various time points, and the data were log-normalized to the initial tumor size at the start of treatment. The growth curves were truncated at the time point when the first mouse was sacrificed to ensure consistent comparison across experiments.\n\n3. **Development of KuLGaP**:\n   - **Gaussian Process (GP) Modeling**: Two Gaussian process models were fitted to the tumor growth curves: one for the treated PDXs and another for the control PDXs. This approach allows for modeling the covariance of measurements over time and accounting for variance within the replicates.\n   - **Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence Calculation**: The distance between the two GP models was computed using KL divergence, which quantifies how different the treatment and control distributions are. The authors used a symmetrized version of KL divergence to ensure the measure is not biased by the order of the distributions.\n\n4. **Statistical Significance Assessment**: To determine the significance of the observed KL divergence, the authors created an empirical null distribution by calculating KL divergences between all pairs of control groups. They then computed p-values for the treatment responses based on this null distribution, classifying models with p-values less than 0.05 as responders.\n\n5. **Comparison with Existing Measures**: KuLGaP was compared against four commonly used response measures: modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST), area under the curve (AUC), angle of response, and tumor growth inhibition (TGI). The authors assessed agreement between these measures, false discovery rates, and the number of responders identified by each method.\n\n6. **Robustness Testing**: The authors investigated the robustness of KuLGaP by subsampling experiments with fewer replicates (three treatment and three control) and comparing the results to those obtained with the full set of replicates.\n\n7. **Clinical Relevance**: The authors validated the clinical relevance of KuLGaP by comparing the treatment responses in PDXs to patient outcomes in a small cohort of NSCLC patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n8. **Implementation**: The authors provided a web interface (kulgap.ca) for easy access to the KuLGaP measure, allowing researchers to apply it to their own PDX experiments.\n\nOverall, the methodology emphasizes the importance of accounting for both control conditions and the variability among replicates to provide a more accurate assessment of drug response in preclinical cancer research."

      "question": "What are the key findings of the paper?",
      "answer": "The key findings of the paper by Ortmann et al. (2021) are as follows:\n\n1. **Introduction of KuLGaP**: The authors developed a new measure called KuLGaP (Kullback-Leibler divergence between Gaussian processes) to quantify therapy response in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of cancer. This measure aims to improve the assessment of drug treatment responses by accounting for both treatment and control groups, as well as the variability among replicates.\n\n2. **Comparison with Existing Measures**: KuLGaP was tested against four commonly used response measures: modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST), area under the curve (AUC), angle of response, and tumor growth inhibition (TGI). The study involved 329 PDX models across various cancer types, including non-small cell lung carcinoma, colorectal, and breast cancers.\n\n3. **Improved Selectivity and Reduced False Positives**: The results indicated that KuLGaP was more selective than existing measures, leading to a lower rate of false-positive classifications. Specifically, KuLGaP classified only 14.6% of the experiments as responders, compared to much higher rates for the other measures (e.g., 64.1% for Angle).\n\n4. **Alignment with Clinical Outcomes**: The outcomes of human treatments were found to align better with the results obtained from the KuLGaP measure than with those from other response measures. This suggests that KuLGaP may provide a more accurate reflection of clinical responses.\n\n5. **Robustness to Experimental Design**: The study demonstrated that KuLGaP could yield reliable results even with fewer animal replicates, indicating its robustness in experimental design. The authors suggested that using KuLGaP could lead to more cost-effective experimentation while maintaining accuracy.\n\n6. **Clinical Relevance**: The authors conducted a clinical validation by comparing PDX responses classified by KuLGaP with patient outcomes in NSCLC receiving chemotherapy. They found a significant difference in the mean time to recurrence between responders and nonresponders as classified by KuLGaP, further supporting its clinical relevance.\n\n7. **Potential for Broader Application**: KuLGaP can be applied to compare different treatment groups, making it a versatile tool for assessing drug responses in preclinical cancer research.\n\nIn summary, the study presents KuLGaP as a theoretically grounded and practical measure for quantifying therapy responses in PDX models, with advantages over existing methods in terms of selectivity, alignment with clinical outcomes, and robustness in experimental design."

      "question": "How was the data analyzed in the study?",
      "answer": "In the study by Ortmann et al., the data analysis involved the development and application of a new response measure called KuLGaP, which is based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between Gaussian processes (GPs). The analysis was conducted in two main steps:\n\n1. **Model Fitting**: Two Gaussian process models were fitted to the tumor growth curves from patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models\u2014one model for the treated PDXs and another for the control PDXs. This approach allows for the modeling of both the covariance of measurements over time and the variance within groups of replicates.\n\n2. **KL Divergence Calculation**: The distance between the two fitted GP models was computed using KL divergence. This measure quantifies how different the treatment and control groups are. To assess the statistical significance of the observed KL divergence, an empirical null distribution was created by calculating KL divergences between all pairs of control groups in the dataset. The significance (P value) of the treatment response for each PDX model was then determined, with models yielding a P value less than 0.05 classified as responders.\n\nThe study also included a comparative analysis of KuLGaP against four widely used response measures (mRECIST, AUC, angle of response, and tumor growth inhibition) using a dataset of 329 PDX models. The analysis demonstrated that KuLGaP was more selective, reduced the risk of false-positive calls, and aligned better with clinical outcomes than the other measures."

This was done to ensure consistent comparison across experiments.\n\n2. **Log-Normalization**: Each growth curve for the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) replicates in both treatment and control arms was log-normalized to the tumor size at the starting day of treatment. This normalization helps in standardizing the data for better comparison.\n\n3. **Handling Missing Measurements**: The Gaussian process (GP) models used in the analysis can handle missing measurements, allowing for a statistically sound estimation of tumor size between measurements.\n\nThese pre-processing steps were crucial for accurately assessing the treatment response and ensuring that the analysis accounted for variations among replicates and the effects of the treatment."

It highlights the importance of accurately assessing drug response in preclinical cancer research, as this directly impacts the translation of findings to clinical practice. \n\nThe authors note that while various measures have been proposed, such as modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST), area under the curve (AUC), angle of response, and tumor growth inhibition (TGI), none fully utilize the available experimental data. Many of these measures either ignore control groups or fail to account for the variability among biological replicates, leading to potentially misleading conclusions about treatment efficacy. For instance, mRECIST does not consider controls, which can result in misclassifying stable disease as a response, while TGI and angle of response focus only on the last measurement rather than the entire treatment trajectory.\n\nThe review also emphasizes the significant heterogeneity observed in PDX studies, where a substantial percentage of individual replicates may yield classifications that do not align with the majority response. This variability necessitates a more robust approach to accurately estimate treatment response. The authors argue that existing measures often lead to overoptimistic assessments due to their inability to incorporate the full extent of experimental data, particularly the variance among replicates.\n\nIn response to these limitations, the authors propose a new measure, KuLGaP, which is designed to address these issues by incorporating both control data and variability among replicates. They argue that KuLGaP provides a more reliable and theoretically sound method for quantifying drug treatment responses in PDX models, ultimately improving the translation of preclinical findings to clinical outcomes."

(2021):\n\n1. **Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDX)**: These are models created by implanting human tumor tissues into immunocompromised mice. PDX models are used to study cancer biology and test the efficacy of new treatments in a setting that closely mimics human tumors.\n\n2. **Therapy Response**: This refers to how well a cancer treatment works, typically measured by changes in tumor size or other biological markers after treatment.\n\n3. **KuLGaP**: This is a novel measure proposed by the authors to quantify therapy response. It stands for Kullback-Leibler divergence between Gaussian processes. KuLGaP aims to provide a more accurate assessment of treatment effects by considering both treatment and control groups and accounting for variability among replicates.\n\n4. **Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence**: A statistical measure that quantifies how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution. In this context, it is used to measure the difference between the tumor growth distributions of treated and control groups.\n\n5. **Gaussian Processes (GP)**: A statistical method used to model and predict data that assumes a Gaussian distribution for the underlying processes. In this study, GPs are used to model tumor growth curves over time, allowing for flexible modeling of the data.\n\n6. **Area Under the Curve (AUC)**: A common metric used to summarize the performance of a model or treatment over time. In the context of tumor growth, it represents the total tumor volume change over the treatment period.\n\n7. **Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST)**: A set of guidelines for assessing tumor response to treatment based on changes in tumor size. mRECIST modifies the original RECIST criteria to better account for tumor volume changes.\n\n8. **Tumor Growth Inhibition (TGI)**: A measure of the effectiveness of a treatment in slowing down tumor growth compared to a control group. It is calculated based on the difference in tumor size measurements between treated and control groups.\n\n9. **Angle of Response**: This refers to the angle formed by the best-fit line of the tumor growth curve in relation to a baseline, used to quantify the response to treatment.\n\n10. **Statistical Significance (P value)**: A measure that helps determine whether the observed effects in the study are likely due to chance. A P value less than 0.05 is commonly considered statistically significant, indicating that the treatment had a meaningful effect.\n\n11. **Variance**: A statistical measure that represents the degree of variation or dispersion of a set of values. In this study, it refers to the variability in tumor growth responses among different replicates.\n\n12. **Control Group**: A group of subjects in an experiment that does not receive the treatment being tested, serving as a baseline to compare the effects of the treatment.\n\n13. **Replicates**: Multiple samples or observations taken under the same conditions in an experiment. Replicates are essential for assessing the reliability and variability of the results.\n\n14. **Empirical Null Distribution**: A distribution derived from the data that represents the expected outcomes under the null hypothesis (no effect). It is used to assess the significance of observed results.\n\n15. **Cumulative Difference**: The total change in a measurement (like tumor size) over time, often used to evaluate the overall effect of a treatment.\n\nThese terms are integral to understanding the methodologies and findings presented in the paper, which focuses on improving the assessment of cancer treatment responses using advanced statistical techniques."

      "question": "How does the paper address potential biases in the research?",
      "answer": "The paper by Ortmann et al. addresses potential biases in the research primarily through the development and validation of a new response measure called KuLGaP, which accounts for several critical factors that can introduce bias in the assessment of therapy response in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs).\n\n1. **Incorporation of Control Groups**: The authors emphasize the importance of including control groups in the evaluation of treatment responses. They critique existing measures like mRECIST, which do not consider control data, leading to potentially over-optimistic assessments of treatment efficacy. By incorporating control data into the KuLGaP measure, the authors aim to provide a more accurate reflection of the treatment's effectiveness.\n\n2. **Accounting for Variability Among Replicates**: The paper highlights that tumor growth can vary significantly among biological replicates, which can skew results if not properly accounted for. KuLGaP is designed to consider this variability, thus reducing the risk of false-positive results that may arise from relying solely on mean values across replicates. The authors provide evidence that their method leads to greater selectivity in declaring responses by effectively modeling the variance within and between treatment and control groups.\n\n3. **Statistical Significance Testing**: The authors employ an empirical null distribution to assess the statistical significance of the differences observed between treatment and control groups. This approach helps to mitigate biases that could arise from arbitrary thresholds or assumptions about the data distribution.\n\n4. **Comparative Analysis with Existing Measures**: The paper includes a comparative analysis of KuLGaP against four widely used response measures (mRECIST, AUC, Angle, and TGI). By demonstrating that KuLGaP yields more conservative and reliable classifications of response, the authors argue that their measure reduces the likelihood of biases that can lead to incorrect conclusions about treatment efficacy.\n\n5. **Robustness to Experimental Design**: The authors also investigate the robustness of KuLGaP to different experimental designs, showing that it can maintain accuracy even with fewer replicates. This flexibility is crucial in addressing biases that may arise from limited sample sizes in preclinical studies.\n\nOverall, the paper systematically addresses potential biases by developing a more comprehensive and statistically sound measure for assessing therapy response, thereby enhancing the reliability of preclinical drug response predictions."

This comparative analysis involved assessing the agreement between these measures and evaluating their false discovery rates.\n\n2. **Statistical Significance Testing**: The authors computed an empirical null distribution of distances (using Kullback-Leibler divergence) between control groups to assess the statistical significance of the treatment response. A P value threshold of less than 0.05 was used to classify PDX models as responders.\n\n3. **Robustness to Reduced Replicates**: The study evaluated the robustness of KuLGaP by performing experiments with fewer replicates (three treatment and three control replicates) and comparing the results to those obtained with the full set of replicates. KuLGaP and TGI measures showed high agreement (95.9% and 94.1%, respectively) with the original results, indicating reliability even with reduced sample sizes.\n\n4. **Clinical Relevance Assessment**: The outcomes of the KuLGaP measure were compared to clinical data from patients receiving similar treatments. The mean time to recurrence was significantly different between responders and nonresponders as classified by KuLGaP, suggesting that it aligns well with actual patient outcomes.\n\n5. **Incorporation of Variance Among Replicates**: KuLGaP was designed to account for the variance among replicates, which is crucial for accurate response classification.

The authors argue that previous measures often fail to account for the variability among replicates and do not adequately incorporate control data, leading to potentially misleading conclusions about treatment efficacy.\n\nThe paper indicates that existing measures can yield different, often contradictory classifications of treatment response. For instance, the authors note that mRECIST can classify tumors as responders without considering the control group, which can lead to over-optimistic assessments. They provide examples where mRECIST classified models as responders despite the untreated tumors growing at similar rates, a situation that KuLGaP was able to identify as a non-response.\n\nIn contrast to previous research, which may have relied on these less comprehensive measures, the findings of this paper suggest that KuLGaP provides a more accurate and conservative assessment of treatment response by incorporating both control data and the variance among replicates.
